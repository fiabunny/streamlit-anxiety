"Final doctor appointment tomorrow, tired of constantly seeking reassurance! Ive decided that Im having my final doctor appointment tomorrow, this is something that has been a huge battle for me, but over the last weeks I have decided that this is the only way I can and will make it out of this anxiety.


Here is the deal: I have been experiencing multiple symptoms as mentioned before in other posts, the symptoms have varied from Brain fog, dizzyness, blurred vision, sore throat, swollen tonsils, coating on my tongue (yellow and white) very reduced energy, fatigue and headaches. The thing is that my sore throat and coating on my tongue wont go away, and my doctor said to come back if it didnt fade over time, the other symptoms tend to come and go so Ive kinda figured out that these are my main anxiety symptoms, which is good because then I know when im getting anxious and stressed out!

Ive been a very heavy caffeine user over the past 2-3 years and ive tried to minimalize the usage of it, as I figured out that i basicly needed caffeine to function at times. Today i used a bigger dosage of caffeine and it really got me feeling off, so I guess i will be dropping it off completely, atleast for now when im feeling anxious and stressed out about my health situation.

Even though I feel somewhat weak and off, Ive learned a lot from this fear of health problems, and I personally think that it had made me a more strong and better person. Tomorrow I will have my final chat with my doctor and I am ready to accept his word for  the truth, hopefully this will take my mind to other places.  Its wierd how something as minor as a sore throat lasting for a long time, can make you feel so sure its something serious!",1
Anyone have bone or muscle pain that was stress/anxiety induced? Ive been having joint and muscle pain that worries me that I have leukemia. Anyone else deal with this?,1
"Listening to your body? I'm curious how those of us with health anxiety can listen to our bodies. It seems the general advice when trying to figure out what's wrong is listen to your body, you know it best, you tell your doctor when something is off.  But it doesn't really work that way when I'm convinced every itch means I have lymphoma or a pimple is a tumour...so how can people with health anxiety know when something is wrong?! I am starting to hate that, I just want to trust my doctor is right when she says I'm fine!",1
"Weekly /r/HealthAnxiety Challenge - Exercise A Little ! Hello, sorry for all the weird Weekly posts lately, finally got it fixed and updated. Here's your next challenge! Let the thread know how it goes for you or share any tips!

"This is killing me So i had a bacterial stomach infection(pain in the right side), thought it was appendix. Doctor gave some antibiotics and the pain went away. But that infection gave me health anxiety for life.
Iâ€™ve been having excessive gas since a month which is mostly due to stress. I was convinced i had stomach cancer, but no black stools or blood and Iâ€™m 20 so doctor ruled that out.
Then i was convinced that my kidney failed, but no. I googled a lot that night and was sure of it, woke up breathless that night.. insomnia took over.
Then i was convinced that i have brain tumor(google is evil), but havenâ€™t really had even a single symptom.

The only concern now is insomnia, has been a month now, I generally get 6-8 hours a day but wake up once or twice a night, Iâ€™m generally a deep sleeper.
Any solutions?
",1
"Constant feeling of being just off For a week and a half now i have been feel off. It is hard to explain, but it is almost like a dizzy feeling without being dizzy. It is really driving me nuts. Health anxiety is the core of my anxiety and has been for years. The first thing that comes to mind is either a brain tumor or aneurysm. I just want to be ok and feel ok. Sorry for the rant. ",1
"Health anxiety following stomach flu, anyone else? I have moderate to severe health anxiety especially when Iâ€™m sick, then itâ€™s pretty severe. 

About 6 days ago I came down with a stomach virus and was violently puking and had water like diarrhea (sorry if TMI). By day 3 I was no longer feeling the nausea or diarrhea, but have a general sense of being unwell/dehydrated/drained. 

I feel as though my anxiety is playing a big factor because I canâ€™t stop thinking about it and feel like Iâ€™m drained and depleted, which isnâ€™t normal cause my energy is usually very high. 

Is it normal for constant worrying to drain you and wear you out physically??? ",1
"The worst things about hypochondria Hypochondria is the worst thing to ever happen to me, everyday Iâ€™m crippled by it. I guess I just wanted to make a list of all the worst things I go through as a hypochondriac.

1. Seeing healthy people and wishing you were like them (even though you probably are healthy but your brain is telling you youâ€™re not)
2. Changing daily routines based off the health issue you think you have at the time
3. Changing your entire diet to become healthier (for me it has been limiting carbs and sugars because Iâ€™m afraid of developing diabetes)
4. Checking your pulse all the time to make sure your heart is beating properly (unfortunately for me my heart is never beating normally, I have constant heart palpitations and my heart races a lot, not even sure if itâ€™s due to anxiety. Iâ€™m scared itâ€™s something serious)
5. Having very bad mental health days where you canâ€™t leave your house (this happens to me a lot)
6. Not knowing if your symptoms are caused by anxiety or something serious (this drives me absolutely insane)
7. Not being able to lead a normal productive (for me I canâ€™t hold a job, because I always fear something bad will happen to me at work and Iâ€™ll panic)
8. Being triggered by seeing things on shows or in movies. For instance, a man has a heart attack in the show your watching and then you freak out about having a heart attack
9. Obsessively looking up symptoms and not being able to stop once you start
10. Wasting a ton of money on doctors appointments only for them to say youâ€™re okay
11. Being in tons of debt from going to the ER because you think youâ€™re dying
12. Always looking for reassurance from others, obsessively asking others if they ever have the same symptoms as you so you donâ€™t feel alone

These are the only ones I can think of right now, but feel free to list the things you deal with as a hypochondriac Iâ€™m curious about what others go through.",1
"Swollen tonsil on the left side of my throat and white spots on it, they say its not strep. What could it be? They said the strep test came back negative. Can allergies cause swelling? They keep saying i need to get allergy medicine :/ I'm afraid they're not seeing the big picture and its gradually gonna get worse if not taken care of. Someone help please. Now im just scared the swollen tonsil will develop into something far worse 

Edit: Is it possible that its tonsil stones? ",1
"I might be losing my mind... Iâ€™ve been suffering from health anxiety for around 6 months now. In the last 6 months Iâ€™ve convinced myself Iâ€™ve had pelvic inflammatory disease, cervical cancer, arthritis, periodontitis, and most recently lymphoma.

I have a swollen lymph node on my neck that feels like two small lymph nodes stuck together, Iâ€™m worried they are matted, which typically points to cancer. I noticed the lump about two weeks ago, itâ€™s maybe 1.5cm in size and moves when I press on it.

Every day I bounce back and forth between anxiety and calmness. Although I say this each time I think I have a new disease, it seems so real this time and I have no idea what to do...",1
"I've been crying all day - sure my time is up About 3 years ago, a good friend of mine passed away from acute leukemia at the age of 19. I was devastated, and with a lifelong battle with health anxiety it always lingered in my mind anytime I would get ill. Would this be the time I faced the same fate?

Well now this time I'm more or less certain that the time has come. I came down with some infection from a coworker back on November 18th. At first is was merely a slight sore throat, some coughing, malaise. I began to feel better around the end of November. Then the first week of December the sore throat came back. And fever, severe congestion, cough, fatigue, achy muscles amongst other things. I began to feel better from that, but have not been the same since. As of right now, I have a terrible cough, irritated throat , congestion. I have been having night sweats where my neck and head get very damp, but I am not drenched and it only affects the head and neck. I am simply not myself. 

The positives that have kept me hopeful I do not have acute leukemia :
-I have been able to make it to the gym to lift about 3-4 times a week. I don't have much motivation to do so, but I make it and my strength is still there. 
-I have not lost any weight, gained a few pounds actually, currently at 6'0"" and 220 pounds
-when I do feel bad, I'm never running a fever, my temp is usually somewhere between 96.9 and 98.5
-I'm not bruising at all, even after bumping into things, and I don't have any petechia anywhere to suggest low platelets
- my infections haven't been severe, per se. I haven't had sore throats like that of strep and no mouth sores or bleeding gums , they've just been persistent 
- I've been going out on the weekends with friends for a few drinks, which ironically when I am not sober I do not experience night sweats at all
- the guy who originally got me sick is still sick himself, and my entire family is sick back and forth

But nonetheless, I can't help but think this is it for me. I just keep looking at pictures of my mom or baby sister or handmade birthday cards from my sister - just little sentimental things - and I start crying like a baby. I don't want to leave them, I don't want my family and friends to go through what my friend's loved ones went through three years ago when they lost her, I love life so much and I don't want it to end. It's all I can think about though.  I don't really know where to go from here. Nobody in my family thinks it's odd I've been sick for the better part of 6 weeks, and I put on a front to everyone that I'm fine to not alarm them, but on the inside I'm falling apart.",1
"Extreme tiredness all day every day Lately, I've been sleeping 12 hours a night and I wake up extremely tired, I can't move for hours because of the overwhelming tiredness. I keep falling back asleep after I hit snooze, and I have intense dreams right away, then my alarm goes off again and the same repeats until I drag myself out of bed because I'm too hungry. 

I am extremely tired all day as if I had multiple sleepless nights in a row, while I actually sleep 11 hours per night. I'm Feverish (but no fever most of the time), I feel like my forehead and eyes are hot and heavy, cold chills with sweating, extreme fatigue, muscular pain all over. I feel like I can't function properly, I'm sluggish and think slowly, my mind is clouded. My eyes keep going out of focus randomly. When someone talks to me, their voice echoes in my head, as if it was waking me up (while I'm already up and awake). I randomly start falling asleep/zone out even when standing up, and get a falling sensation when trying to resist. 

It's true I had insomnia for awhile, and whatnot, but I don't know why I keep being so tired now that I am sleeping. I do wake up multiple times per night, because my mouth is dry, or because I have to pee or other things, but it's not really new. I think my sleep is just not normal, or something is very wrong with me.

I'm tired of being tired. I've convinced myself I probably have leukemia, anemia, sleep apnea, narcolepsy or something else. :( I don't even have the energy to go to the doctor.

Am i dying?

Edit: I've been taking Nexium for 5 months, and the leaflet says it can mess with your white blood cells, causing intense fatigue, pain all over and a fever. It can also cause hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, hallucinations, insomnia 
Etc. maybe that's the culprit? The side effect list also reads ""Sleep disorder"", what could it mean? I've tired stopping this drug but it's making me sick.",0
"2018, already panicking... So, last year, I had multiple blood tests an X-ray and an ultrasound due to abdominal pain. I was also getting pains in my legs, and weird hot sensations too. 

Doc said bloods were fine, no lymphoma or leukaemia, or diabetes, and nothing else to worry about. 

Here I am 2 months later and Iâ€™m getting pain in my left arm too. In the muscles specifically. No idea of the cause. Worried as fuck. Also keep waking up itching (since I had oral thrush and took some meds, left me itching on and off) and had a rash this morning on my arms. 

Anyone have any ideas. All I can think is strain of some kind or low vitamin d but Iâ€™d expect that to show up in a blood test. Totally stressed about it all. ",1
"Visiting my sick girlfriend across the country. What should I do? Iâ€™ve had a trip planned for months to visit my girlfriend across the US for 5 days. She is just now recovering from having a serious cold where she had 104 degree fever and intense symptoms. I would like to sleep in the same bed as her, but I know for a fact that Iâ€™m gonna get sick being so close to her for 5 days. The trip is still gonna happen and Iâ€™m leaving tomorrow. How should I go through with this without getting sick? Thanks guys! ",0

"Convinced I have lymphoma So I just turned 20 and I have myself totally convinced I have lymphoma. About two months ago I noticed a lymph node on the left side of my neck that was enlarged. Well, it's still there. It doesn't hurt (which I've read is more worrisome than painful ones), it fluctuates in size throughout the day, its not rock hard but it's not really soft, and I can't really move it that much. I'm really worried that it's lymphoma, I don't have any swollen lymph nodes under my arms, groin or collarbone that I can tell. Nor do I have any other symptoms that are commonly associated with lymphoma, but I know that a lot of people don't show any symptoms so it's not really reassuring. I don't have health insurance so I can't go to the doctor as I please. However I am trying to get into this affordable doctor near me within the next couple of weeks to ease my mind. I've been having panic attacks over it, last night I had one and I was seriously about to go to the ER but my boyfriend talked me down. It's so exhausting. 

Edit: Also, I haven't had any infections or been sick to cause the swelling ",1
"Heart health anxiety Hi all, stumbled across this sub doing, what else, some late night symptom googling, and I couldn't be more glad to see it. I've had generalized anxiety for years, but recently it's started to manifest more as health anxiety, triggered when my cat died of sudden onset congestive heart failure a few months ago. 

I've had chest pain in the upper left side for almost a week now, and I can't seem to convince myself that I'm not dying. I've had two normal EKGs, normal bloodwork except for an elevated d dimer level, and a normal x-ray and CT. After all that, I'm still not able to stop my anxiety that the twinge in my arm is a heart attack, or the burning sensation in my back is an aortic dissection. Any suggestions for calming the anxiety beast? ",1
"Carpal tunnel or als? This post is from my other post on askadoc and wanted to see what info I can get on here. Thanks in advance 

I am a 25 year old female. I went to the doctor a couple days ago, they did the phalan test and they said itâ€™s carpal tunnel. But I occasionally feel weird nerve pain in my thighs and feet. I have no other symptoms other that minor twitching (that could be from researching so much on google). My grandmother died of ALS so it worries me whenever I have nerve issues. 
",1
"Finally getting better. My anxiety was to a point where every few days I was posting in the sub and r/Anxiety. I suspect my anxiety was worsened by being on antibiotics, at pretty heavy doses destroying my gut bacteria, and a hormone imbalance from going on and off of birth control after 5 years of being on it (been off it for 3 months now). Noticed it was WAY worse in the week leading up to my period, the week of, and a week after. This cycle, I actually only had anxiety *during*, and before it was because I was flying (huge fear of mine). Whatever imbalances I had, I think they've finally begun to balance out.

Now, my only health fear at this moment is a DVT from the flight from LAX to Hawaii, even though I know it's mostly from long haul flights, and I obsessively made sure to move in my seat as much as possible... not to mention I was rather active during my stay in Hawaii. My left leg has some weird muscle twitches every so often, but none of the other symptoms-
 in fact the twitches aren't even a symptom. But damn, I'm so much better than I was at my peak anxiety weeks. 

This year, going to go to therapy, and I've started exercising (though I'm afraid my heart will give out despite being only 21, pretty healthy with a perfect EKG and no health issues, and a former athlete, my heart races bc I'm simply just out of shape... baby steps). 

What helped me a lot was writing down my instances of anxiety, and working through them. It's called ABC therapy model used in CBT. http://images.slideplayer.com/20/6041594/slides/slide_10.jpg

When I wrote down my current fixation, such as a brain tumor, I wrote down why I felt that way (even symptoms!), reasons why it's probably not likely (had two physical brain checks, docs said I was fine just head and neck tension, and I didn't have any severe symptoms). Then I wrote how I felt after working through it.

Pinpointing my anxiety to particular times, such as my period, helped me realize that it's really likelu just a hormonal thing, and ya know, every time I was about to be or on my period I probably didn't have cancer or a tumor or some horrible disease or ailment because I knew it was most likely just anxiety. I encourage you all to journal your anxiety! It helps you see trends, it helps a ton to rationalize.

"Soapy taste in mouth. Sodium Fluoride poisoning? I started noticing a soapy aftertaste when I was drinking coffee a little while ago. I first thought it was something in the coffee maker, but I then drank some water and it had the same soapy after taste. I had a friend taste the water and they said they didn't taste any soapiness. It became obvious it was just me. It's possible I got some shampoo in my mouth when I shower shortly before drinking the coffee, but I don't remember that happening. 

I decided to Google soapy taste in mouth, and it said it's a possible symptom of sodium fluoride poisoning. My hypochondriac side started getting worried. I drink a lot of unfiltered tap water but I don't know if that's enough to get sodium fluoride poisoning.

"Flat Stool and Dull Stomach Pain. Could it be IBS? Colon Cancer? Just flat out Anxiety? Lately I've noticed that my stool has been softer, floating, and generally flatter than before.  They are not absurdly flat, you'd only notice it if you examined them closely because they float around. I've really noticed this over the past couple of weeks. I haven't really had a solid and long stool in a while. In addition to this, I've been having some dull abdominal pain that kind of radiates on my sides and in the middle of my abdomen. Nothing that keeps me from walking around and exercising though. The pain radiates for a couple of minutes and subsides when I stop thinking about it.

I went to the doctor two weeks ago complaining about the abdominal pain (this was before I noticed anything about the poop). I had a blood test and a urine test taken and basically they came back all clear. 

For the record, I'm 19, male, and overweight. My college diet combined with inaccessibility to the gym has caused me to gain weight over the past two years.

My biggest questions for are these: When is the right time to contact my doctor again? Since the blood and urine tests came back completely normal, is it right to assume that my stool is just a byproduct of me being anxious and general change of diet? I'm on my school's winter break. Meaning this is a big diet change and physical activity change. I'm no longer eating food in bad dining halls, I'm making my own.

IBS? Colon Cancer?? Please help me out. From Googling, I'm convinced I want a colonoscopy.",1

I've been under a lot of stress at work for a long time. I'm responsible for the finances in a company which has been teetering on the edge of bankruptcy for several years, and in September I had my first ever panic attack over worries that we wouldn't be able to make payroll.

I've felt over the past few months that I can't think or write as fluently as I could. I make more mistakes. I feel scatterbrained and foggy, and I struggle to concentrate. I feel like it takes me longer to do things that should be much easier than I'm finding them.

It's led me to start compulsively and repeatedly testing myself on things I ""should"" know, which of course makes the anxiety and racing thoughts worse.

"Dr.â€™s office blew up my phone about results of blood test Iâ€™ve been suffering from health anxiety for a few months now after a lymes disease scare in November. I found myself fine tuned to any aches/pains in my body at this time out of paranoia of getting lymes disease. After my blood test came back negative, I still felt these aches and pains and now started to attribute them to severe diseases, like cancer, and driving myself crazy. These pains seem to be deep in my bone and very painful, but I simply donâ€™t know if theyâ€™re psychosomatic or real. I find it hard to believe I could imagine these pains, but at the same time I didnâ€™t feel these pains before my scare back in November. I finally went to get a physical for the first time in 4 years last week and also requested a blood test.

Fast forward to today, an unknown number called me 4 times and left a message the last time. It was the Dr.â€™s office notifying me my blood results came in. I feel very uneasy about this... why not call once and leave a message? The multiple calls are freaking me out and makes me feel the results are really bad.

Unfortunately, when I start getting excited for it, my health anxiety kicks in and I can't help but think that I might not make it because the symptoms that my anxiety produces, and that my mind thinks are real, will end me before I can experience it.

"Trying a new way of thinking. My day normally looks something like this...
Oh man I'm dizzy. I wonder what that means. Any my left arm is weak. Is that a heart attack? Maybe a symptom of a small heart attack? Where did I get that bruse on my knee? Is that a sign of a blood clot? Should I go to the doctor again? Last time he told me to stop worrying about stuff like this. Is that a lump I'm the back of my head? Maybe that's what's causing my head ache... But what is the lump is another sign of a problem? Should I start documenting this? The doctor thinks I'm crazy but if I have all the symptoms with the times I had them he could surly run more tests. A friend I knew died for a blood clot that the doctors missed maybe my doctor missed something... etc

Recently, I started asking my friends that don't have anxiety how they deal with strange feelings in their body. Every single one of them says that they almost immediately dismiss the thought. I can't even imagine what that feels like. I focus on a part of my body so much sometimes that I actually create pain that doesn't exist. So I dug a little bit deeper and asked what happens if they were walking around one day and all of a sudden they noticed that their left arm was weak and tingly. Most of my friends with without anxiety said the same thing. I guess my arm is weak today. And then that's it. If they have a headache or if they have a chest pain or if they have an upset stomach or if their leg hurts out of nowhere they just shrug it off and think oh I guess today I'm going to have a stomach ache or I guess I'm coming down with something or something to that nature. And then if it still hurts the next day they shrug it off again and only when it's continuing to do it for like a week do they actually think I'll maybe I should go to the doctor and have it looked at. But it's not in a panicky kind of way it's just kind of like almost annoyance.

So I'm going to try that method. ""Oh I guess I have a headache today"". And try to leave it at that. If it lasts a week, all the  talk to my doctor.

"One hell of a year Hi, just discovered this subreddit and wanted to sort of share my experience with this. For the last 7 months or so I was totally convinced I had some sort of cancer. It all started when noticed a swollen lymph node on the side of my neck. The lymph node had been swollen for about 2 years and i never thought anything of it until i went to ol' Dr Google. Fast forward countless doctors appointments, a spur of the moment ER visit, CT Scans, and an eventual biopsy and it turns out I don't have any life threatening conditions. 
I got so obsessed with cancer that I started going to dermatology clinics because I was convinced that some of my moles looked suspicious (of course they were fine). 
I mean, I worked outside a lot without sunscreen and a permanently swollen lymph node is unusual, so I guess I was right to be somewhat concerned. However, I really blew it all out of proportion for a long time and despite all evidence pointing to being healthy, I cannot shake this sense of impending doom that I've had for the last 7 months. It's honestly making it hard to move on with my life and enjoy things. Anyone else have issues like this? How do you deal with it?",1

"I think I have bone cancer Im 20 years old (male) and im 6' 3"" 170 lbs

Let me start of by saying that for most of my life i think i have symptoms and i think im gonna die everytime untill i finally go to the doctor aand find out its some minor problem.

Ok so in spring of 2015 i noticed the muscle above my knee was twitching a lot so i got into the habit of feeling that area every day until i noticed a hard lump developing on my bone. I was CERTIAN i had bone cancer until i found out i had osteochondroma wich is a benign tumor and not life threatining. I decided not to have it removed.

Two years later (this last summer) i started have muscle twitches all over my body. Those lasted like 5 months and they still happen occasionally but mostly they've been replaced by painful/tender spots on various bones in my body including my spine.

Anyways the bones in my feet hurt a lot and in my hands. Butttt basically every bone in my body has a spot where it hurts.

My pee also started burning last summer and i was tested for various STDs  and the doctor just kinda brushed it off just like he did with all of the other symptoms im describing. And idk if this is related but ive been constipated for 11 days but i can go with laxatives.

I usually go to the gym but havent in a week in a half due to travel and ive actually gained 20 pounds (in muscle) over the last 6 months.

What i really want to know is there ANY possibility that this isnt serious?

And for those wondering i'm going to the doctor to get this checked out as soon as im back in town.

Also i stopped taking my adhd meds about a month ago that id been taking for 5 years",0
"Hey guys. Please check this out. My heart goes out to all of you experiencing this. It is crippling and mental torture when it gets out of hand and it feels like it has so much control over you. The world definitely puts enough things out there to scare us, but not enough to comfort us and assuage our fears. There is definitely a lack of balance and it's so frustrating because mental health is SO important. Anxiety can make you feel like you are going crazy and to me, that is the scariest and most deeply troubling symptom. The feeling that I can't trust my mind/myself and that I've lost who I am completely and I'll never be the same. That's what fear and anxiety can do to you when not properly addressed!

I am only on the second module, but this is the most helpful source I have found for this illness and I am hopeful that I will get better. Please please pleaseeeee at least look at this.

Advice Hey everybody you may have seen me post on here a lot recently and I do apologise for that I don't want to waste anyone's time. However since November when I'm stupidly ingested cannabis one night and ended up in hospital because my heart went to fast my anxiety has got so much worse. That night in hospital I was convinced I was gonna have a heart attack and die I was in so much pain and agony and in the ambulance the paramedics said my heart was going to fast but this was down to anxiety and nothing wrong with my heart. Same in the hospital they tried to treat my heart with medication but they couldn't slow it down they said this was because it was not an irregular heart it was normal just a bit fast once again due to anxiety so I was left over night and discharged the next day. December 4th I dislocated my knee for the 2nd time and while waiting to be seen in hospital my heart went to fast so they put me in a ward over night and did all the tests bloody tests for my heart and ecgs nothing once again and anxiety once again. Then after that is when my intrusive thoughts started and that went on for a few weeks I still get it on and off now however. But the last 2-3 days my heart has been going fast I'm losing my breath easily and I can feel my heart palpitating I've had countless doctors and tests look at me and nothing to do with my heart? I've even rang a hotline about this and they said anxiety does all this it seems to go in a cycle my thoughts then everything is okay for a while then my heart and thoughts again can anyone help?,1

Iâ€™m getting down to single digits on days and I feel terrible at nights. Iâ€™ll experience acid reflux, or muscular/skeletal pains , etc. Right now I have a pain under my right rib cage and I feel like itâ€™s my pancreas or something . Iâ€™m going absolutely mad just thinking that this dull pain could be cancer or something I need to go to the ER for before it bursts and I die . 

I just canâ€™t wait for 5 more days until I can get checked out and be able to sleep at night knowing either nothing is wrong with me or taking steps to manage it. And now Iâ€™m in a worse mood because I wonâ€™t get the results then , Iâ€™ll still need to wait a week or two on top of that . ",1

Well, I was taking a bath after exercising and I didn't really do anything but turn to the side to reach for some bath gel and I felt something similar to a pop in my chest. It was right in the area that my heart would be. I thought it was odd, and when I stood (slowly) I felt a little light headed to get out of the bath.  I had two short, quick pains in that same spot and now I haven't had any pain since that. There is no heaviness in my chest. My stomach is fine.

"Fear of brain aneurysm Hi, everything started in April/2016 when I read on the news that a boy of my age had an heart attack and died, that made me scared so I started thinking about my own health and got really nervous, one night before going to sleep I was feeling terrible, with a lot of headache and my heart was pumping really fast, but I managed to relax, the thing is after that day I started feeling a burning sensation in a specific spot on the right side of my head, from there on I started to panic a lot thinking I had an aneurysm and everything, with the upcoming months that burning sensation became a light headache, I went to the doctor and did a tomography and everything was fine, he gave me a medication to take and advised me to start exercising. I did it and after about two weeks now I feel less frequent headaches but when I feel it, it feels more intense, I don't know if it was because of the exercises but I'm scared thinking this supposed aneurysm is getting larger and it's going to rupture :( Thanks.

"Going to Battle HA? Hi All,

First time posting here. So grateful to have found this community. I have struggled with HA for the last 10 years, with each year worse than the one before. 

For the last 6 months, my HA has been with leukemia. Usually my anxiety with any illness is from a few days to a few weeks, but never on the order of months. Enough is enough! I no longer want to live in fear of any random bruise (I am thin and bruise like a peach), or to have my husband constantly reassure me that I donâ€™t have cancer and engage in my safety behaviors. 

A relative of mine is actually a clinical psychologist who deals with anxiety disorders. She referred me to a well-respected clinic that is able to work with my insurance and they want to schedule me for the intake. 

The problem? Iâ€™m scared to actually take the next step and start therapy. Iâ€™ve avoided dealing with my triggers and upbringing that promoted me becoming this way. The clinic specializes in exposure therapy for anxiety disorders and I am so scared thinking about putting myself in even controlled situations that will manufacture my anxiety. 

Has anyone successfully done therapy and conquered the HA monster? I just need to pick-up the phone and make the call. Would love to make progress on this in 2018. Help?",1

"question regarding fingers slightly moving. Is it normal?

Not sure if I can classify it as 'tremors'

Basically, from what I've seen with different kinds of videos regarding tremors, it doesn't look like it.

Let's say I put my hands in the air facing my palm, or just in the bed resting, it doesn't shake or what.

But sometimes, if I look at them long enough, I notice it they slightly move.

Not sure if I'm doing it voluntarily, I'm being anxious, thus, making it move, or maybe because I'm not used to holding that kind of position, it kinda moves because of it?

If anything, I type a lot in a computer. Upon searching, I've seen that they might just been twitching due to fatigue, so maybe that's what it is?

As much as possible, I don't want to go to a doctor just because of this.

Thanks",1
"I finally saw the cardiologist today I had multiple ECGs, bloodwork done, I wore a two-week loop and I had an echocardiogram over a month ago, and today I did a stress test. I've been having HORRIBLE anxiety about my heart for over a month and a half. 

**My heart is completely healthy. No blockages and no damage to it whatsoever.** 

This is one of my happier days!!! 

They told me the chest pain -- which I can reproduce by touching it -- is likely caused by either anxiety or costochondritis and the heavy tightness is likely anemia (which I can deal with much better than heart disease). The left arm pain is probably from inflammation because I lay on it so awkwardly and for too long at night. 

I'm OK :') 

Anxiety is a bitch, guys. It can make you truly believe and FEEL the most frustrating and uncomfortable symptoms. I'm not saying to dismiss everything as anxiety -- it will always be better to see a doctor -- but what I am saying is none of you are alone.

"Health Anxiety after panic attack Almost a year ago, I had a panic attack that I thought was a heart attack. I've never had either, and at the time I didn't know that panic attack symptoms can mimic heart attacks. I had a friend take me to the ER, and I was freaking out in the ER while waiting to be seen. I remember thinking ""man, this is it, this is how I'm going to die and I'm away from family, wife and kids and everyone I love and I'm stuck in a place I hate"" and it scared me so badly. Anyway, since then I've almost had myself convinced that I was going to die and it was going to be from a heart attack. I've been prescribed Buspirone and it keeps me from having panic attacks, and I've come a long way from the panic attacks every day to almost having none. There's been a few times in the past few months where if I wasn't taking medication, I could've had a pretty bad attack. One of them was last week, where my mind just kind of ran away while I was driving home from work and for some reason my mind was looping ""you're gonna die, and probably run into oncoming traffic, look now you're barely breathing"" and I had to calm myself down. It sometimes takes me a really long to get calm, and sometimes I can calm myself almost immediately. The thing about this though that I really hate is that the anxiety is always there, always either in the back of my mind or I'm actively thinking about it. I've set an appointment with a psychologist for a few weeks from now, and I really want to get off the meds. They have some side effects that I really don't like, and they are considered mild. Are there any of you who suffer from the same kind of health anxiety that I do? I don't know anyone personally who does, at least not in the way it is with me. Some co-workers had anxiety issues in the recent past, but it looks like I'm the only one who suffers 24/7 and it looks like it's a permanent thing in my life. ",1

"Dog died on New Years, scared of rabies Okay so I posted this on the anxiety subreddit and that should of been enough but my anxiety still is being awful so uh-- posting this here too since health anxiety is a big one for be in general anyway...? Sorry ;;;

Basically, I had an old dog, like 14 years old. He started sleeping a lot more around Christmas, and all, and when I cold front blew in that week, he started having a harder time walking around (he'd been wobbly already), and then Thursday he collapsed on his front legs and couldn't eat back up. His front legs couldn't move, but back legs were fine, and he ate and drank what we gave him fine. 

During that Thursday I absent minded lot scratched the inside of my nose after doing something and he licked, which is what started the paranoia.

My poor dog couldn't move, but his back legs still could--- and his jaw never got paralyzed and he never got the excess salivating deal.

We have him pain meds at a vets advice, which seemed to of gotten his front legs working again, still back legs working too, he just couldn't get up yet. But he was moving more, his head too. He even ate that day. Unfortunately, he started bloating, fell into a coma, and died that day, which was New Years.

I've brought my paranoia up with the vet, and he did say with everything I told him and showed him that rabies shouldn't even be a concern. Another commenter seemed to agree too.

And--- yeah, I know better--- he wasn't even paralyzed in that way, it was the pain in his bones--- the pain meds helped him, in those final moments. And he never had a hanging mouth, he could move it and eat fine, and didn't foam or excessively salivate or anything. But even still, I've been absolutely paranoid every since despite knowing better. Despite knowing that wouldn't of been rabies, since if it was his limbs wouldn't of gotten better--- but my mind keeps telling me what if it is, what if it is--- what if it's too late and you'll have it and your mom will have it and you'll die--

Ugh. I know I'm going to get a full doctor checkup tomorrow, and take steps to get help with my anxiety, but as it is right now it still feels so awful and constraining.

"Uneven pupils on Friday I was looking in the mirror and noticed that my left pupil is much larger than my right. The vision in that eye is also blurry. 
I visited an optometrist today who dilated my eyes and confirmed that the left is more dilated than my right, but he didn't know why. He assumed that its something I've always had but only noticed now, but that's impossible because for the past year I have been obsessively checking my pupils in the mirror to make sure i haven't had a stroke (hello health anxiety). 
a few days before the uneven pupils, I woke up with a painful pulled muscle on the left side of my neck, could that be related? I also have occasional tinnitus in the left ear, usually pulsatile (rushing noise). 
 I'm afraid its either a carotid dissection/stroke, or some sort of tumor. Maybe I had a seizure in my sleep that cause the pulled neck muscle and the eye issue?

"I feel really silly posting this but... I think Iâ€™ll feel better if I get this off my chest. I definitely have some health anxiety, although itâ€™s not as bad as it could be. I recognize that many of the symptoms I feel from time to time are a result of internalizing stress and are made worse by worrying about them, and I think Iâ€™ve gotten a better handle on it as the years have gone by.

But I donâ€™t think anxiety can cause lumps or make them grow, and Iâ€™m trying to stay away from Google and redirect my focus but Iâ€™m still feeling that worry and wanting to check on the lump every five minutes. I think Iâ€™ve done a fairly good job keeping myself in check and only examining the lump once a day. But Iâ€™m going to write this out and see if it helps. Maybe someone else has had a similar story and everything turned out fine? I want to hear it if so.

Close to a year ago now, I noticed this lump under my arm. I thought it was an ingrown hair. Mentioned it at a checkup, the doctor felt it and thought it was a lymph node. She offered to do an ultrasound but I was getting ready to move out of state and didnâ€™t have time. The lump grew and became really painful and red. For reasons, I didnâ€™t see a doctor until about eight months later, when they diagnosed the lump as an abscess next to a (swollen) lymph node. Abscess was drained, tested positive for Staph, I got a gross course of antibiotics and that was that. The lymph node shrank a little after that and I could still feel a lump where the abscess was. Primary care doctor said it was a cyst that had formed form the abscess being left alone for so long, and sent me to a surgeon to have it removed. The surgeon was not very nice, told me he couldnâ€™t feel anything and sent me home. Eventually the cyst shrank and I couldnâ€™t feel it anymore. 

Fast forward to two months later and now...the original lymph node has shrunk but itâ€™s still around. And now above it thereâ€™s a new...mass. Itâ€™s next to where the abscess was before but off to the outside top corner of my armpit (sorry for the bad explanation). Itâ€™s a hard lump and fixed in place, which freaks me out a bit because google says thatâ€™s a sign of cancer. Buuuuuut maybe itâ€™s just my muscle Iâ€™m feeling. The other armpit has a bit of that â€œbumpâ€ thing going on at the top, but itâ€™s way less pronounced and feels less like a defined lump, if that makes sense. And it feels like itâ€™s growing. Thanks to the abscess I have a scar and it feels like the lump is noticeably getting closer to the scar. 

I feel like such a drama queen. Iâ€™m so embarrassed bringing stuff like this up at the doctor because Iâ€™m so used to being dismissed and them thinking Iâ€™m a huge baby. I just feel ashamed of being like this. Being stuck between worry or embarrassment isnâ€™t much of a choice. But this nagging voice in my head keeps saying anxiety canâ€™t cause a lump like it could cause a headache or nausea or heartburn or whatever. I just canâ€™t cope with the humiliation if it turns out being nothing and they think Iâ€™m an idiot. I have an appointment with my doctor (for something unrelated and not to do with something being wrong with me) and Iâ€™m debating on if I should bring it up. My doctor now seems really good and non-judgy, these feelings are internalized. If someone else has had a mysterious bump that vanished one day and ended up being nothing please let me know.

"Im 19 y/o and my hair is thinning and more worrying symptoms I first noticed my hair thinning two months ago. I've always had thick hair that would grow pretty quickly. Now my hair's gotten thin and quite dry. The thinning is more extreme on the sides of my head with visible patches; at the top there arent any such patches (but still thinning and dryness).  I impulse-bought biotin tablets to help with the thinning, but im hesistant to take them at the moment since nothing's been diagosed yet.


But it's not just the hair. I have also been getting, although not frequent,  a tingling sensation in my right fingers,  and sometimes on a whole hand at times. 

More recently, say the last week or so, my vision's gotten blurry. I don't know if the  blurred vision is  permanent and i've just gotten use to it, or not, but ive definitely had these phases. 

Ive looked up my 'symptoms' and what's come up are thyroid conditions, B12 deficiencies and a whole load more. With B12 deficiency in particular, its symptoms seem to align with mine pretty closely. Other than my symptoms ive mentioned already, B12 deficiency symptoms include 'tiredness' and 'memory loss'- i feel like i have these, or atleast they're more pronounced recently (ive always been fairly forgetful).

Im genuinely worried if i have some serious conditon. Ive booked an appointment  with my doctor and hopefully i can get however many of these symptoms i actually have sorted. Sorry for this being so long winded. Stay healthy friends.

"WARNING: graphic. Stomach Flu, Food Poisoning, or neither? Hello,

last night after going out with my boyfriend to get Mongolian Grill, I got back to his house and my head began hurting like a migraine. What was even worse is a few minutes later, my stomach started feeling weird. I brushed it off and was able to ignore it, however, normally if it is nothing or I am having motion sickness, it dies down after a while. It did not. I began feeling REALLY nauseous, and just plain weird. I was also having a lot of small burps and...gas down there. So then I thought, must be gas as this has happened before. 3 hours go by, and I literally cannot move or I feel like I am going to throw up. We go to his momâ€™s house, and I try to lay down and sleep. And then I got that feeling maybe 30 minutes later, went to the bathroom, and puked up all of my food. I have never puked so much in my life. It hurt really bad, and to make it worse every 30mins-1hr after that I threw up 8 more times, as you can imagine I got ZERO sleep. It has now been about 5 hours since I threw up, and I feel absolutely fine. My stomach does feel a little raw, as expected. But I am able to sip gatorade and suck on ice chips right now with zero desire to eat. 
This is where things get nastier: about 20 minutes ago I was laying here kind of sitting up, and I felt gas down there so I obviously decided to let it out. Worst mistake because, I SUDDENLY FELT IT WAS WET DOWN THERE. And boy, was it.
I ran full speed to the restroom, and it turns out to be what appeared as a mixture of super watery diarrhea, and vomit. Absolutely disgusting, I showered and here I am now.  hours ago before the last few times I puked I did have to poop, it was weird it came out of nowhere and I went and it was big and soft. And then this!
What makes my boyfriendâ€™s mom suspect it is the stomach flu is because my boyfriendâ€™s sisterâ€™s boyfriend threw up the other night too, however, she didnâ€™t get sick, I was nowhere near him, and he had a concussion. I donâ€™t have a fever either (atleast I donâ€™t think I do)?
I feel like food poisoning is the culprit because I have had it before and this same thing happened, besides the bathroom situation from what I remember. Just constant throwing up over and over again. I did eat a lot of lettuce and spinach, so I hope it isnâ€™t e-coli.

Any advice would be appreciated. ",0
"Meningitis Hi Reddit,
For a week now I've had a stiff neck, this has been accompanied by cold hands and feet and random pains in my limbs, I also got off an antibiotic a week ago for a tooth infection. Headache has not been present, maybe just a mild one occasionally, have mostly just been a little drowsier than normal. Could this be meningitis? Getting pretty anxious.

"the HA just won't quit... So, long time lurker and first time poster. Just have to say how helpful this subreddit is for calming me down during a heath anxiety meltdown!

Background: My mom was diagnosed with breast cancer about 7 years ago, went into remission, was re-diagnosed with stage four bc a year and a half ago, and passed away about six months ago (it had spread to her brain). I'm 23 female and she did not carry any of the BRCA genes.

Around 5 years ago, I felt a small bump in my armpit while doing a self-exam and went into a full blown panic. After about a month of constantly poking and prodding and googling symptoms, I forgot about it and the next time I checked it had disappeared. I noticed it again a year later and had a physical around that time and asked my doctor. She said that it was fine and nothing to worry about (can't remember if she said lymph node or cyst...I was just so excited I was not dying)

Fast forward to six months ago when my mother passed away and I became hyper-aware of anything breast-related. The small lump is currently present. It's come and gone a number of times since I first noticed it years ago, it's always in the exact same spot, lasts for various amounts of time, it's 'biggest' size has never changed, and when it's 'gone' I can kind of feel a little remnant. It's under the skin, not hard (but not exactly soft either), can move around but tends to move with the skin it's directly under. Sometimes when I get poking at it for days on end it hurts a little bit and the skin gets irritated. My aunt has suffered from cysts most of her life and has gotten a lot in her armpits and my step-mother, who is a nurse, has told me that I'm fine.

Basically, I know it's not cancer (most of the signs point to the fact it's not) but Google, of course, tells me that I'm dying of a million different cancers (mostly lymphoma or metastatic breast cancer). I have an annual exam in around a month and I'm going to ask about it for the peace of mind, but I just can't stop worrying about it. Any tips? It's just so frustrating to know I'm being completely ridiculous but it's like I have no control over it.",1

"Convinced myself I have Celiac disease? I've been lactose intolerant since I was 20, and got diagosed with GERD as a child. However I just recently did a dumb thing and looked up symptoms of celiac disease and am rationalizing going to the doctor and getting tested.

No one else in my family, even extended, has had lactose or acid problems. Eating gluten with celiacs long term can cause those problems. I've always been underweight (5'11, 130 lbs). Im also always tired, though I think my iron levels are fine and I cleared a thyroid test a few years ago. When I have more than 3 drinks in a night, I have severe vomiting the next day to the point I've gone to the ER because it had been every hour, for 8ish hours.

For someone this anxious about it, you'd think I'd track these things better. But now I'm locked into a very shitty vegetarian diet at work chock-full of products with gluten for the next 5 months. Would I be justified in going to the doctor just to lay all this out there and see if its related, maybe to celiac? Or am I just being paranoid?",1
"Afraid i've been exposed to hantavirus, really panicking So I'm on Vacation in a friends cabin a couple miles north of Lake Tahoe CA. It was freezing last night so I went to the closet to grab an old comforter to add to my bed. What I had forgotten is that there is a mouse problem in this house. 
I woke up this morning and found a couple mouse droppings in my bed. I googled if that could be dangerous, and panic ensued. 

I've googled the cases hantavirus reported in California, and many of them focus around the area I'm in. There was also a case near Reno (really close to here) just last fall. There's mouse droppings littered in the carpet of this house, one here one there, and now I've slept with a blanket that had them in it. We're only here for 2 nights total, so we didn't clean the place. I'm so scared for myself and my family.

"Do I have Anxiety or Schizophrenia? 18 - Male - 5'8 - Caucasian - no previous diagnosed medical conditions or medications - but I think I have Social Anxiety and mild GAD. No relatives that I know of with schizophrenia (however my dad is adopted so I can't know for sure)

I KNOW only a psychiatrist/gp can diagnose me properly. I am asking here to see if it's worth to do so.

For maybe half a year now I've had constant anxiety of having schizophrenia. It started with me being in school, walking through the corridor and hearing my name being called, even though I know I probably just misheard someone else talking. I went home and googled schiz symptoms, and since then have been constantly worrying about it..

Other symptoms -

Music playing in my head. Can be hard to make it stop. Sometimes when Iâ€™ve smoked weed it feels literally impossible to make it stop.

Constantly repeating conversations in my head, or preparing for future ones. Also, it feels like most of my thoughts are thought of as if im in a conversation, if you understand what I mean by that.

Auditory hallucinations (?) - Heard my name being called a couple of separate times when walking around town &amp; in school. However, one time at a night club it happened like 5-8 times in one night, (was quite drunk &amp; anxious the day/evening before). It's NOT in a distinct voice, its just someone else next to me who's talking about something completely different, and my brain just misfires and I hear my name instead.. Also, Idk if it counts as hypnagogic hallucinations but when I meditate I, a random word or sentance can pop up in my head, but it can be in a different voice than my own inner monologue - often someone i know. However it really doesn NOT feel like a voice talking to me, more like intrusive thoughts that are in the voice of someone else (but iâ€™m the one thinking?, its not loud or anything)

Quite often, several times a day, when seeing some random person on the street I recognize someone I know for a split second - then I realize it wasn't them. Saw some interview with a dude with schiz who said this was one of his first symptoms but with cars

Poor control of my inner monologue. I tend to overanalyze every single thought that I have. Because of this I have somehow caught the habit of thinking- Would someone with schizophrenia do this, or does this mean I have schizophrenia?

Seeing things out of the corner of my eye.

Slight sensation that people in school might be talking shit about me (however like 2 seconds after that happens I realize how ridiculous it is)

I have smoked quite a lot of weed the last 2.5 years but lately have not been smoking much at all. It tends to make my anxiety worse and hyperactive - the last time I smoked when i was walking home i was paranoid about anyone looking at me through windows and when I walked past 2 guys I was convinced they were talking about me.

No delusions, paranoia (when sober), depersonalization, social life is good etc. I feel ''sane'' but can not stop having thoughts of schizophrenia.

What do you guys think? I posted a similar post in r/askdocs and r/schizophrenia and most of them said I'm fine, but I'm still extremely scared.",1

Mine is from today: I cut open an avocado, and where the stem was it was all brown, but everything else looked fine. Tried to convince myself it was fine, made the whole avocado toast and when it came time to eat it...I was too scared of being poisoned/getting sick or something (I mean, can that even happen??) that I scrapped off all the avocado and now I'm sitting here with my plate full of damn avocado that I know was most likely perfectly fine to eat lol

"Bruise anxiety I have a bruise appear on my outer thigh. About an inch wide. 

3 days ago when I noticed it, it was actual 2 bruises, a smaller and larger bruise.

The next day, the smaller bruise was nearly gone. The larger looked like it was fading. 

Last night, the large bruise was a red circle, which was not what it looked like the night before, which got my anxiety up.

Today it's spread a bit and now a dark red, turning purple ish and I noticed I have a lot of spider viens in that area. 

I'm so scared it's a blood clot or something worse. Should I wait and monitor it or go to doctor?

"HA for two weeks - just discovered what its like Hi all;

So the last two weeks have been a ride for me. I've always had a buildup of wax in my left ear (runs in the family). A few weeks ago I noticed a ringing noise in my left ear. I went to the doctor and they said it was an ear infection. So I started taking antibios ... didnt go away. So today I went to an ENT, who suctioned out my ears and gave me stronger antibiotics and reaffirmed me that this is most definitely a temporary phenomenon and will go away in time (1 week, 1 hour, 1 month ... he said ears take awhile to heal). I had this confirmed by many of my friends that experienced ear infections as well. The ringing will go away, just in time.

The problem is... throughout the past several days, I spent the majority of my time convincing myself that I had some sort of major illness. The first concern was cancer, then that turned into a meningiti, then that turned into inner ear concerns, then that turned into HIV concerns ...

I don't know how I arrived at any of these conclusions. I had no symptoms of any of these illnesses, yet I immediately assumed that I had them. No way do I have meningitis, I would know by now ... no way do I have cancer, it doesnt really run in my family nor do I display any other symptoms. No way do I have aids ... I have not exposed myself in any way that would put me into a situation where it was possible. 

My friends and peers are all convinced I have anxiety issues and need to see a counselor. I went to one last week and she pretty much confirmed that I have anxiety issues that are beginning to manifest themselves in a moderate form of hypochondria. I literally started checking myself every day for things .... lumps, rashes, bruises .... 

I write because I'm curious to know other people's stories. How do you cope with this? This constant anxiety-driven fear of having a major disease. I've spent so much time over my break from school researching illnesses, conditions, symptoms ... trying to connect the dots from anything I could have possibly been exposed to in the past. The slightest itch would terrify me. An ingrown hair on my belt-line convinced me I had an STD. 

In effect, I didn't actually live the past week. My worrying sapped away from my actual living. 

Sorry for the long drawn out rant. ",1
"Having a horrible HA week. This week my HA has just went flying back off the rails. It started with the usual heart palpitations, thinking im on the verge of cardiac arrest. Then i had a day of thinking i was gonna die of sepsis, for literally no reason at all. Like i didnt even have an injury. I keep washing my hands too much. Cleaning the absolute shit out of my house. And as of yesterday my head has settled back on the good ole fear of getting Rhabdomyolysis from powerlifting. Because i think i overdid training yesterday. I had a back injury that kept me from doing specifically squats for like almost a year. So i have been afraid to do them. Deadlift and bench are fine and i go heavy. But i have really only been doing squats on the high volume speed work day. I was doing pause squats with only 1 plate (per side) on the bar. Its way too light and i have been afraid to go heavier. So yesterday i decided to do box squats 10 sets of 2 with 30 sec rest. With 1 plate and one chain (per side). For resistance. It felt easy and i completed it and went on to do the rest of the exercises per usual. But then it sudden hit me that i did more weight with high volume than im used to on that particular exercise.  I do more than double that weight on deadlift, but still, thats not the same. And ill probably get rhabdo. Later on in the evening i felt nauseous and i think i have some pain in my quads. No other symptoms. But i read you could have it and have NO SYMPTOMS WTF. Idk if the nausea and migraine i got was from the major anxiety from the rest of the week leading up to this or from rhabdo. Im really trying to not do the whole panic and go to the ER thing that i always do when i get like this. Im ruining my sleep schedule that i worked really hard to fix (i have insomnia from ptsd), and i didnt want to sleep until i knew i didnt have it. Im still panicking over it today. And as soon as i get anxiety the nausea comes back and i think about the minor soreness in my quads and how its going to kill me or make me very sick for a long time and ruin everything. Its fucking awful. ",1
"Fucking amoeba again I'm in Egypt and, while taking a shower, I managed to inhale a small droplet of water up my nose. I didn't feel it, but I'm sure it went up there because I sniffed very hard and the ends of my hair, beaded with water droplets, were dangling right in front of my nostrils. I looked it up (why did I do that) and apparently the tap water here is full of that fucking amoeba that eats your brains. Now I've got the 15 day incubation period to endure, knowing that every twinge in my head could signal my doom. Fuck my life.

"Crippling fear Hey guys, Iâ€™m posting this because I want to see if Iâ€™m the only one. My grandma passed on her hypochondria to me, and ever since I suffered a spinal injury my sophomore year of highschool Iâ€™ve been terrified of doctors visits and every little pain, ache, tingle, and spasm I get in my body. I went to a sports specialist for my back and he diagnosed me with a C5 fracture, and scoliosis. I can live with that. But after I became aware that my body is injured and no longer the same, Iâ€™ve been obsessed with the idea that I have cancer, a brain tumor, or MS. Usually itâ€™s cancer that takes over my thoughts.

My thing is, I avoid the doctors office in every way possible. I HATE the idea of going to the doctor, being diagnosed, because to me my life is over at that point. I can usually talk myself through my panic episodes, but I usually seek the reassurance of others. I have a mole on my back and Iâ€™m convinced itâ€™s changing, so every other week I ask my girlfriend if itâ€™s changed and she says of course not. I canâ€™t remember what it looked like as a kid, but I couldâ€™ve sworn it didnâ€™t look like it does now. My anxiety is so bad I went to the doctor when I had a flu that wouldnâ€™t go away, got chest x-rays to rule out pneumonia, and before my doctor told me the results I told him, â€œlook, if I have cancer I donâ€™t want to know, just donâ€™t tell meâ€ and he looked at me like I was crazy because the X-ray came back perfectly fine, just a common flu.

Iâ€™ve avoided the doctors office for so long now that I feel like there HAS to be something wrong. Terminal. I know I should go, but even thinking about the idea makes me shutter with fear. A lot of the posts I read on here are about people that go to the doctor too much, but I wanted to see if there were people out there that are like me.",1

"IBS/psoriasis My story and never would have thought what was causing it!! I want to share my story because I believe thereâ€™s a lot people out there in my situation. 

When I was younger in high school, I would get diarrhea going to class, mostly happened in the morning. This was around the year 1999. I had psoriasis on my head for most of my life. It would get bad from time to time, but never went away.  The doctor would prescribe an ointment that stunk like gasoline. I would put this on head and it felt like it was burning the skin off my skull. So I never really used it, just suffered as is. 

Now back to the diarrhea issue. I went to the doctors and they did everything you could imagine. Blood tests, stool tests, upper and lower GIâ€™s, and the good old colonoscopy! In the end the doctor said that I was a healthy young man. So he diagnosed me with IBS.

Once I graduated from high school it seem to simmer down to where I never really had any more symptoms. So I figured that is was over. 

Years passed by and once in a blue moon the IBS would come back. But the psoriasis never went away. I moved forward in my career, and in my personal life. I thought that the nightmare I had when I was younger would never comeback. Boy I was wrong! One day at work after having something for lunch my captain and I had just taken off we were in the air for all of ten minutes. I looked at him and said we have to go back and land! He asked what was wrong, I replied that Iâ€™m going to crap my pants. So we turned the plane around and landed without incident. 

The next day my manager called and asked what had happened and I replied that I must have ate something I shouldnâ€™t have. 

Months rolled by with no farther problems other then the psoriasis. 

I upgraded to captain and loved what I was doing. Then one day, it came back only this time it didnâ€™t go away!! Much worse, I started taking Imodium gel caps one before the flight and as prescribed as many as I need during the flight.(this was a bad idea for me, but we will come back to this)
So off to the doctor I went and of course started to do familiar tests. Only this time after all the testing the doctor didnâ€™t just say it was IBS but it also must be in my head. Now itâ€™s time to send me to a shrink. 

There I am, off work by this point sitting on a couch playing head games at the same time trying not to mess myself. After the third session I said â€œitâ€™s not in my head, no way!!!

My wife is going crazy by this point with me not working, so off I went with the same problems back to work. The first day I tried to do one flight. Had diarrhea threes times and kept taking Imodium trying to fight it. I didnâ€™t even get the engine started. I went back off work. 

Then my wife said â€œyour going to do whatever I tell you to do nowâ€! I was game because I just wanted this to be over. She sent me to a natural-path doctor, I thought that this was going to be a joke, but played along as Iâ€™m willing to do whatever by this point. This ended up being a game changer for me. I told her what was happening, and she said â€œtell me what you eat I the run of a dayâ€. I told her and she replied that it sounds like a FOOD INTOLERANCE, and that itâ€™s a simple blood test. I said that I already been tested, she replied â€œthatâ€™s for allergiesâ€. 

I agreed to the test. About three weeks later she calls me, say the results are in. I went to see her she said I had three different intolerances one was potatoes another was cane sugar with fruit, and the last most important....soy. 

That day I eliminated all three and within a week all my symptoms were gone including my psoriasis, even the little bumps on the back of my arms went away!!

I was so happy, the only problem now is that I have to prepare all my meals and read every label of anything I want to eat. So living on the road as an airline pilot makes it tough, but Iâ€™ve got it down now.

Soy is what was causing all my problems, and if I have it today it comes back at full fold. Now remember how I said I was taking Imodium GEL caps, well one of the ingredients is SOY.  Just like a car, jamming on the brakes while hitting the gas!!

So I had medical problems that regular doctors couldnâ€™t find, went to a naturalpathic doctor and found out that I have a food intolerance to Soy.",0
"HIV Anxiety About 3 weeks ago, I was the insertive partner in unprotected anal sex with another guy. He claimed to be HIV- and sent me test results from November proving so.

"Bump on the (fore)head I have noticed that there is a â€œbumpâ€ - itâ€™s bone though, not actual bump as when you bump your head against something - on one side of my forehead. I can definitely see it looking from the profile. I havenâ€™t ever really spent ages investigating my forehead shape, but Iâ€™m pretty sure it wasnâ€™t there always - however, I couldnâ€™t tell how long itâ€™s been present either. Years ago I had a pretty bad head injury in an accident, but I was overall ok and havenâ€™t really had any problems since - so Iâ€™m guessing itâ€™s probably not directly related, if there is anything... As of recent I have developed strange little symptoms, eg. I feel like Iâ€™m clumsier/less well co-ordinated than before and my muscles on one side feel a bit strange/achy sometimes, but these things arenâ€™t very consistent and arenâ€™t really getting worse, theyâ€™re probably in my head and they do get better with vitamin B.

I know I tend to be a bit hypochondriac and after that accident years ago I was, understandably, pretty paranoid about anything head-related - thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m hesitant to actually speak to a doctor in case they think Iâ€™m crazy and I waste their time on nonsense.

"Second opinion for cancer? Hey there.

I'm a 24 y/o female and in early October 2017 I noticed a lump on the left side of my neck about the size of a pea. Assuming it was from a cold as I had been coughing quite a bit. I let it go until I noticed again in early November it had grown in size. I noticed another under my right jaw and my doctor ordered an ultrasound and the left one measured 1.88 cm x 0.92 cm x 0.98 cm and the right one measured 1.27cm x .76cm x 1.06cm. I had other swollen lymph nodes as well, but this was the one I could feel from the outside.

The ultrasound tech ordered another test through my GP (although my GP was hesitant to sign the form for my follow up) for early January, so I went on the 2nd. The left lymph node is now 1.74cm x 1.03cm X1.0cm and the right lymph node is now 1.79cm x 0.91cm x 1.22cm.

I've also found that my cough has gotten worse despite not having any other ""cold"" symptoms (runny nose, sneezing, etc) as well as I am finding myself very short of breath with a chronic pinching/squeezing sensation below where my bra band sits. My doctor ordered a pulmonary function test and we are waiting for results. I find myself waking up in the middle of night really hot and sweaty and I have been getting an itchy rash on my stomach that comes and goes. When I mentioned this to my doctor she didn't think anything of it (I thought I might be getting fevers at night from a bad flu or something).

I'm a little worried because the lymph nodes mentioned (as well as the other 8 or 9 notes in my ultrasound) have seem to have grown in some way or another and I'm hoping my doctor doesn't dismiss it like she did the last time. Would you reccomend a second opinion? Seeing if the lymph nodes grow more? I would love some peace of mind on this.",1

"Irrationally terrified of seizures I have spent today being irrationally terrified of having a seizure. I've never had a seizure before. I've seen my sister having a diabetic seizure, but that's as close as I've gotten to ""experiencing"" one.

My anxiety stems from the fact that people with retinal migraine are at a higher risk of experiencing seizures and strokes.

Then there is this: I was prescribed Wellbutrin last week to help with getting out of bed in the mornings (coupled with venlaflaxine). My psych informed me that drinking alcohol can result in a seizure while on Wellbutrin. In addition, so can combining Wellbutrin and aspirin/Advil. He said Tylenol is OK, and I checked online for any drug interactions, too, which confirmed that it should be OK. I have a cold today and an upset stomach, so I took some Tylenol Cold &amp; Flu pills to relieve it.

And then I spent the rest of my evening preoccupied by the idea of having a seizure because I took Tylenol. I even contemplated seriously telling my boss that I could have a seizure, along with wanting to tell my coworker that if I am on the ground shaking uncontrollably that it is a seizure and to call an ambulance.

not just a bit of anger, it has to be a decent amount...

scared nobody else gets them from anger...",1
"Insomnia Last month, I suddenly developed the worst case of insomnia I've ever had. I'll literally lie in bed for hours and I can't fall asleep. I can't even fall asleep to nap after a night of little sleep. I'm wondering if anyone else here has ever experienced that.

"Afraid to get worked up I posted here befpre about my healyh fears related to the head/brain mostly focusing on tumors,meningitis and the thing I hate to type out that involves bleeding in the head from a weakened or expanding blood vessel.

I got a CT scan last month due to head pains ,nausea and dizziness. It was without dye/contrast and the scan came back nornal accorsing to the doctor. I still fear what I fear since I noticed whenever i get slightly annoyed or mad I feel a pressure or slight ache or pain at the top of my head. It even happens when im not getting angry but someone is getting mad at me. Now I cant help but think the worst. Im scared to sneeze or strain during a BM too. I also notice a squeezing senation like muscles squeezing on the top or back of my head whenever i gwt anxious or come inside from cold weather.

Theres no history of what I fear in my family and I dont have high BP or smoke/drink. Im 80 lbs currently and I have been seeing therapist recently.

Edit: changed weight after checking it.

Update: tmi but had to go pass a bowel movement and qas a little difficult and i felt tension or pressure in my head qhile going but no headache afterwards",1
"Very worried about my first blood test [22 year old male from London, England]

I have never had a blood test before and I have decided to bite the bullet and get one next week. I am going to be requesting a blood test on Monday due to some GI problems I have had since November (which started when I started taking a daily multivitamin), although have not been serious enough to warrant consulting a medical professional but not mild enough to be ignored completely. I am absolutely terrified they are going to turn around and say that I have a serious form of cancer or IBD (there has not been any bleeding, fatigue or fever though). I know it's an irrational fear because I frequently exercise, 75% of my diet is healthy and I don't smoke, drink or do drugs. However, I still feel as though they are going to call me up and ask me to be at the hospital immediately. Reassurance would be appreciated! ",1
"Iâ€™m a gay male hypochondriac so anxious about getting HIV. Itâ€™s affecting my life and relationships. Why do I feel like this? I have always had some form of hypochondria and more recently it has overrun my life and relationships. 
I am deeply anxious all the time.  Iâ€™m not intimate because of fear even though Iâ€™m in a monogamous relationship and Iâ€™m very conscious of my surroundings. For example , if Iâ€™m walking and someone coughs near me I have to look the other way or turn around directions. If someone sneezes same thing. I have to get as far away from them.  Also if I go out to eat , i have to see food being prepared like sushi or salads in front of me , if I notice something off like worker using no gloves or touched something differently I buy the salad and struggle to eat it after inspecting it for blood or bodily fluid many times. 

I feel like my body is contaminated or some disease is brewing inside me all the time even though my latest blood work last August was all negative.  Iâ€™m a habitual hand washer and sanitizer and I use alcohol to sanitize my razors toothbrushes before every use.  

I know HIV is very hard to get but over the past couple years i have been tested over 100 times including majority  over the counter HIV test for $40 each. This is crippling me and I want to resolve this fear. ",1
"I fear I was bitten by a bat or something Hello,

I just need to get this off my chest. It am always worried about something with my health.About a week I was walking in my backyard. It was really cold in PA like below freezing. I had a coat and jeans on. When I was walking back I felt something near my knee. I didn't think anything of it. but I get random feelings all the time but nothing is ever there. But then a day later I found this and I am concerned. It doesn't itch or painful and its gone now. But for some reason I think it is a bite from something. My parents think I am crazy.

"Blood(???) in Stool Alright so this is an issue Iâ€™ve had on and off for years and I donâ€™t know what to do. So basically, sometimes I have red spots in my stool. I say spots because it doesnâ€™t fill the whole bowl, the whole stool isnâ€™t red, just red spots. It also appears on my toilet paper time to time. Iâ€™m 21 now, and the first time anything happened was probably 5 years ago. Doctor did an occult test, found nothing but a hemroid, sent me on my way with a cream and I was fine for a while. Itâ€™s happened on and off since then and usually I either know itâ€™s hemroids or I can trace it back to something red I ate. Recently however, itâ€™s gotten worse. About a month ago, as my semester was ending there was about a week where I had stomach pains and twice in that week my stool had these red spots. I went to a local walk in clinic and had another occult test done and it also came back nevative. The doctor said it was probably something I ate. Iâ€™ve been fine this past month, but I just flew back from Europe and twice in the past 3 days Iâ€™ve noticed the same red spots. Now each time it happened I had a red fruity drink the day before so I still donâ€™t really think itâ€™s blood, but if thatâ€™s the case wouldnâ€™t it appear as a liquid in the bowl and not a â€œspotâ€ as Iâ€™ve described. 

Part of me wants to go to the doctor but I was just verified a month ago that it wasnâ€™t blood, and I feel going again will just lead to the same result. Iâ€™m just wondering is it normal to have any redness in your stool once in a while from food and Iâ€™m just overly vigilante, as health anxiety definitely has made me, or is there more to it.

Scary throat problems I had 2 respiratory infections in about a span of a month and when it finally began to clear up I had an persistent globule feeling in the opening of my throat.

"Canâ€™t tell if panic attack or allergic reaction. Please help. So I have what I think is the common cold and decided to take Mucinex DM. After I took it I noticed there werenâ€™t any effects listed on the package at all so I looked it up online. Well it says the most severe side effect is chest tightness/difficulty breathing. I was kinda already having chest tightness before I looked that up. Reading that made it even worse. 

The reason I canâ€™t tell if itâ€™s panic or not is because I started getting bad anxiety after reading about the flu epidemic and how it caused death and stuff. This was all after taking it.

"Health Anxiety is ruining my life. So it all started getting worse when about three weeks ago I accidentally got hit in the forehead with a soft car seat... I wasn't knocked out or anything, A &amp; E said I had no serious injuries, no bruise etc. 

My Health Anxiety's like, ""Well how do you know you're fine, you should see a doctor again so that nothing new has come up.""

I go to the doctor, I phone two different doctors and they tell me I don't have any signs of a serious head injury... I end up freaking out a few days later because of persistent headaches and feeling spaced out, so I go to the A &amp; E again, a different doctor gives me a neurological examination and tells me I don't have any serious injuries and should be more concerned about my anxiety. 

Then out of nowhere one of my relatives has a heart attack and is in hospital (he's fine and well now) and I start to worry. A few days after visiting him, I'm at my boyfriend's house and lying in bed... I'm getting these headaches that have lasted about a week now as well as a sudden pain in my arm and chest, and become totally convinced that I'm having a heart attack or a stroke. It doesn't help that I was starving myself because I was so stressed out; I had lost half a stone in the space of a week. I thought that I was dying because I hadn't eaten and was having heart problems because of this.

So now my HA brain thinks I've had a stroke twice without noticing or being diagnosed and that I have a damaged brain and that I also might have a brain tumour.

I've not been able to smell or taste things as well since I got a minor bump on the forehead, but it's quite possibly the case that my anxiety is convincing me I have these symptoms... so I've remained in this constant heightened state of numbness because of my anxiety; believing that I have some sort of serious condition... I was even at an audiologist because I believed that a visit to the cinema had permanently damaged my hearing, everything was fine and he said I had no hearing damage...

I go to the doctor again because of my severe anxiety; she tells me that all of my symptoms (headaches, ringing in ears, loss of sense of smell) are being caused by my anxiety. She prescribes me with propranolol... naturally I look up the side effects and become terrified to take the medication.

Just today, I started getting a headache and was convinced I was taking a stroke again. I've became kind of emotionally numb now because I'm constantly ruminating about what could be wrong with me health-wise. I can't even enjoy things anymore because my HA goes, ""Well maybe you can't enjoy that or feel much emotions or think about that the same way as you did before because you have brain damage caused by an undiagnosed TBI or a stroke."" I can't pay attention to things.

It doesn't matter what the doctors say, after a few hours I'm always convinced that they're wrong and that there's a serious problem with my brain and they haven't been able to find it yet.

I'm so sick of this. Can anyone else relate?

How do you convince yourself that there's nothing seriously wrong with you? ",1
"2+ years of relentless HIV anxiety - please read and KEEP CALM For the last couple of years, I have been utterly petrified of HIV. I'd say it has crossed my mind at least once an hour for the last 2 years and 4 months. Statistically, the chances of me having it were  alwaysridiculously small, and none of the science would support the hypothesis that I had contracted HIV.

But some brains work in funny ways. And mine is an example of a brain that immediately believes the worst possible outcome. And I'm sure there are many many many more out there who have wrapped themselves in a similar web of self-loathing and utter panic. The advent of Dr Google is good, but it can also do some terrible things for our mental health.

The solution the whole time was simple: test. Test and set yourself free. It's hugely important on so many levels to know your HIV status. For your own health, for your sexual partner's health. For the sake of the NHS. I am so glad I got tested. I can literally feel a part of my brain resuming activity. It feels strange not carrying around the fear I had been carrying before; it has literally given me a headache as my brain tries to decide how to reallocate this space.

I had ALL the symptoms. Absolutely text book seroconversion illness. Fever, sore throat, swollen glands, night sweats, stomach discomfort, everything. Doctor's presumed it was glandular fever, but tests never confirmed the presence of the EBV (which it should for glandular fever). Classic ARS. Of course, after a couple of weeks I was back on my feet again, and the doctor was quite content.Then about a year after this, I came out in a weird rash that wouldn't go away for like 2 weeks. Seemed like some sort of bacterial infection (to me). And it always got worse in the sun. OBVIOUSLY my immune system was compromised.

From the moment of my ""glandular fever"" my brain had convinced myself I was carrying HIV. But I wasn't brave enough to test. I was being cowardly. However, over the last few months I've been having some stomach issues, which are pretty non-specific, and the internet didn't really help me link it to HIV. The doctor did suggest a CBC test for me though, I think just to get an idea if anything was going on, blood-wise (obviously lol). I was told by the nurse who carried out the blood test that it was very much a case of ""no news is good news"".

Of course, having had the blood test on Monday, first thing on Tuesday I got a call from the doctor. My white blood cell count was low, and she wanted me to come in so she could feel my lymph nodes. AHHHHH! My brain went in to overdrive. I couldn't cope. This was it. My worst fears realised. Why me? Why me?!! That's exactly what HIV does - it attacks white blood cells. Nooooo!

I went in for the doctor's appointment, and she said all my lymph nodes were normally and no cause for concern.

She did then say, ""I would like to test you for HIV"". My world was crumbling inwards. I couldn't believe that this was happening to me, a very conservative, early twentys, heterosexual male. I looked at the statistics to such a deep level, that I knew that in my country of residence, there was only 32 males aged 15-24 who were HIV positive. That's essentially like 0% of the population. I was about to become a medical phenomenon.

The doctor eventually decided just to take the CBC again in 6 weeks time, and that we wouldn't test for HIV just yet (as I kind of freaked out when she suggested the HIV test). But the time was now - I needed to know. I would have no quality of life with this intense level of anxiety coursing through every fibre of my being, every second of the day. I had a second job interview for a pretty plush job that day, and I totally flunked it due to the unbearable mental tension I felt.

I did manage to summon the courage to order a HIV home test kit, which I had delivered to my family home, where I would have the test in the presence of my family so that I could receive immediate support from those closest to me when the test returned a positive result (and in my head, it was very much of WHEN not IF). I spoke to them on the day the doctor said about my low WBC, and they were all wonderfully supportive (did have to speak to my Mum about my sex-life though - not ideal).

So I went home yesterday, and I had the test. And, of course, it was a big fat NEGATIVE. Which it always has been. It was a crucifying 15 minutes waiting for the test to work, but during those 15 minutes, on a deep level I felt a sense of peace. The band aid had been ripped off, and life was going to move on.

HIV is the worst for health anxiety, as almost everything can be linked back to it. The anxiety can make your brain question everything - I was even questioning my ability to swallow at one point. But the chances are, going off the plethora of statistics out there, you don't have it, whoever you are who is out there searching for every piece of HIV research ever (which has been me for the last two years). But still, if the anxiety is as stressful and overbearing as what I was experiencing, you need to get tested. Now. Somehow. Make it happen.

I took the time to write this in the hope that someone who is currently going through a similar thing to what I went through, can find solace in it. You will be alright regardless. You are a good person. But you need to put your mind to rest. You need to have the test. 

'Thinking Fast and Slow' by Daniel Kahneman teaches a brilliant lesson in terms of this. Our brains are desperate to come up with a story that will justify our irrational way of thinking/catastrophising. But numbers matter. Statistics speak volumes. You are not special. You are overwhelmingly likely to be normal. You aren't the 1 in 100,000 shot. You are the 99,999 out of 100,000 shot. Our brains struggle to compute the true values of these numbers, but we must try. 

Peace!

"Convinced I'm dying. First post in here - very nervous so it'll be long winded.

On Monday, I had pain under my armpit and across my chest on the left side. I convinced myself I had everything from breast cancer to heart failure. Went to the doctor on Thursday and she diagnosed me with shingles. My rash is more like a cluster of spots, and it's not itchy or have any of the other symptoms.

Since then, I've convinced myself my organs are failing and that I have a blood clot.

The latest is breast cancer. Was in the shower and noticed a small, about an inch long, patch of skin that's red. No itch, no rash, spot or lumps. It's not hot to touch. It's just red skin. The thing that's throwing me is that it's on my right side, whereas the shingles is on the left.

I've alway suffered with anxiety, but never health anxiety. I've just bought a house and I'm moving in on Friday - I'm starting to think that because I'm not stressed about that, I'm stressing about every single twinge in my body. For example, I'm now extremely dizzy. It's a side effect of the anti vitals, but I'm here writing a will.

"I'm scared It started with me checking randomly my neck and noticing a lymph node which if I recall correctly I have had for at least a year and another behind my ear which was there for years (I went to two doctors and at different times and got told there was nothing to worry), but I keep checking my neck basically everyday and keep finding others which I don't know if they were there before or not and my anxiety is getting worse and worse.

My throat doesn't feel ok even though I got checked by three doctors. I feel like I have a bit of nausea and the other day I had a bit of fever which only lasted one night. Also my left ear from times to times feel obstructed which I've been told is due to my nasal septum deviation.

And I could list a lot of other stuff that's wrong with me but that would get too long.

"I think School gave me social anxiety story is, since I was born until I was 12 I was bullied, no big deal because I am not traumatized and I am actually in good terms with my old classmates now, but, being bullied made me what people call ""a NEET"" I don't mind talking to people or going outside.... well, I guess I do set some limits to myself when it comes to socializing (to the point I am almost always quiet)

I blame the school system, at least on my country, because it's made in a way that even when I moved to the US, it just isn't easy to socialize with others because you have to be quiet or talk low, this also gave me troubles with talking low usually, it's hard for me not to, well, I scream a lot when I watch videos (I am kind of crazy xd) but in my comfort zone only and well, I spent most of my days on a pc watching videos and having fun

My parents also just don't know how to take care of a child, you see, I got depression and maybe something else thanks to my dad, he isn't abusive, he does things for a good purpose but the way he does it made me hard to tolerate him (the slightest thing, even just saying a bad joke, if it comes from him it would make me mad over the line, and I don't want to feel like that but I can't avoid it, I dunno why, it's just how he made me). I also don't find anything to do outside my house and that's why I don't even ask to get out of there adding how overprotective my parents are and when I actually do want to they just don't let me (I almost never go to my friends houses, I had a friend who didn't care when I went but hey, after 2 visits I couldn't anymore because of their paranoia and being overprotective, I don't hate them for that, not even mad, I just dislike how few chances I have of doing stuff like that)

I think I am forgetting something.... I don't know.... I am not diagnosed with social anxiety nor seen anyone to tell me I have that, but I dunno my man, I am trying to explain my story but it's so badly structured that I just want to get to the point, I am a NEET and I am used to live on the internet just chatting with people through text messages
but today, I tried VRChat and I just.... couldn't talk, I wanted to, but I couldn't, most of the times I just think my voice isn't right for my words and a lot of times, I just don't know, I can't, maybe I feel insecure? I just wonder if there's a way to fix this.... I don't think it's deep
I don't feel pretty good now, I was getting too bored in the game and I got tired of not doing a thing in VRChat, my plan was to be a silent person and interact with people but it's hard without VR, and it still gave me the chills to interact with them. I am frustrated because my voice... it isn't bad, but I can't think of a avatar who would fit it, my own appearance doesn't fit with my voice, and even though I know many people have appearances that don't fit their voices my words, my words are just what can't get out, by just thinking how it will sound or saying it to listen to it
This is annoying, I don't really hate my life, I had fun when I was 10 and didn't have any friends, just spent the whole time watching videos and playing game, and I still had fun when I got friends on the internet or people to talk to (ironically, people ruined that fun ""a little bit"" xd at the price of making it more fun) I am having fun now but now, well, I just handled depression I guess, but talking to people is still something hard to do for me, at least I got friends in my school, but I am still just too quiet and I am annoyed by that, I also find it almost impossible to start conversations, or just impossible (but, without speaking.... meh, it feels like there's no risk, I dunno, when I type I don't think I could mess up, not because of my voice, but it's still pretty hard, but I think that's how it is usually, hard)

I wanna add that my family aren't something I can call friends or people to talk to, they have a lot of issues that are responsible for who I am now, I also almost never talk to them, specially when I just think there's nothing to talk about (with most people actually, but there's a fewer amount of topics with them)
And well, that's my thing, I just want to know if there's something I can do, sorry for wasting your time, this is a mess, I don't normally make such a mess when I type stuff but this is one of the things I found the hardest to talk about (not emotionally), I usually make a mess when I find things hard to explain or to type, but this one is just the worst xd oh well

I recently had been dealing with acid reflux, doc believes to be due to IBS which had me on a tear and now I'm dealing with this.Now I'm having a non stop tingling cramp ish pain in my inner thigh and knee and sometimes pain in my hip and it doesnt seem to be relieved by anything,I'm doing -anti-inflammatory pills, stretching, ice, compression.. Nothing seems to work, no lumps or redness or swelling idk. I'm going mad.",0
"Yay. A new thing to worry about. Tonight while taking a drink I swallowed wrong &amp; am convinced I aspirated some into my lungs. Spent the last 15 minutes Googling &amp; am now worried I will end up with aspiration pneumonia.

"I'm really struggling I've suffered with Anxiety for about 5/6 years now, however in the last year my health anxiety has gotten extremely bad. 
Everywhere hurts at different times or different days and I constantly think I'm going to die. Whether it be a pain in my chest, or a rash on my arm or even if I find a bump one somewhere.

About a year and a half ago I started saying  'touch wood' if I or anyone else said something worrying that might happen. Eg if I said 'I feel like I'm going to have a heart attack' followed by me saying 'touch wood' and then touching something wooden. It made me feel secure, like it made it not true and it wouldn't happen once I said and touched it.

However it then got extremely out of control to the point where any time I even thought about something happening to me I'd tap the side of my head twice (for some reason this was my new 'touch wood instead of trying to find something actually wooden) 
I still say it sometimes, but if I only think of something terrible happening I won't say anything out loud but rather say it in my head and touch my temple twice. I know this sounds crazy weird but I literally can't go a day without doing it now. 

My health anxiety is so bad. I've been reading other posts and I relate to most of them which really stresses me out. I will always go to the worse case scenario and I can't stop. I'm constantly getting pains in my arm or numbness, shortness of breath, chest pains, headaches, shaking etc. I know/hope deep down its my anxiety but I can never calm myself down.

To make it worse my boyfriend gets annoyed at me for 'constantly being sick' ie when I have headaches or even when I get a numb pain or something he usually tells me I'm over reacting which makes me more stressed and upset. 

Idk if this is even the right place to post and even posting it is making me super anxious. I just can't get a moment to relax. My whole life is revolving around my anxiety. Every single day I think of death and how this might be my last day etc.

How do I stop this? I'm really losing my mind.

"Where I'm now with depersonlization/derealization So its been 7 hard crushing months but im glad to say it's mainly over. However, it wasent easy. If u haven't read about my subreddit about how to deal with depersonlization I highly recommend u check it out. If u r still dealing with derealization plz message me YOU ARE NOT ALONE. Trust me I'm the most paranoid kid I've been through hell and back with this. 

So near about October/November I thought about DP (depersonlization) less and less, honeslty it's gotten so much better for me and i thank God for that. However I've not felt the same. Sometimes I feel like time is moving fast or that I'm in a simulation but that's just me being me;even my friend who has never taken weed or had DP is also thinking about these things. 

The good news is it does get better bad news is it takes time and motivation. I personally had to go to a psychiatrist about my problem however yall be fine without one. My thoughts took over me and i felt more depressed than depersonalised; Don't get me wrong some days I thought I was dead like literally. For a solid 5-6 months or so I woke up everyday and it was the first thought on my mind it was shit I couldn't talk to my bro without thinking he and myself weren't  real, i honeslty felt suicidal. 

Then some day I just woke up and i didn't think about it don't know why just didnt. I learned to control my thoughts but not to block them out. It's like me saying QUICK DONT THINK ABOUT A DOG ON ICE, boom bet u thought that, fuckin  magician I am. Anyway it's all about  acknowledging your thoughts don't block them out or try to get rid of them however don't let them take over you. Say to yourself 'I know you're there I'm just not in the mood to talk right now' it's like a fly in the room the more you try get rid of it the worse you will exhaust yourself however if u see it u wait don't put your full attention on it and let it see it'self out. 

Overall time is a healer and depersonlization taught me a lot about life and i hope whatever stage you are at now it gets better. Stay cool and collective, peace my dudes :) ",1
"Visual migraines? A few months ago, I (starving, dehydrated, anxious, overworked uni student) was sitting in my school before a class when suddenly this weird curvy shape appeared in my vision, specifically in my left eye. Kinda like if you stare at a light too long and youâ€™re left with a retinal image for a bit, except this was kinda flashing and obscured my vision. This weird episode lasted for about 30 mins, and occurred again three weeks after that, and again a week after that. Thanks to the internet (and my mom, who says she has a history of these in her past), I self diagnosed myself with visual migraines (which can present themselves with no pain, as my episodes did). At the time I took this as a call from higher powers (aka my brain?) that I needed to get more sleep, drink more water, eat better, etc. and I hadnâ€™t had an episode for two months.
Well I just had another one of these episodes, and although today happened to be a very bad eating day and I was super dehydrated, Iâ€™m starting to worry about these. What if I have a brain tumor? What if Iâ€™m going blind? What if Iâ€™m about to die? These are the questions pounding through my head right now. Any advice? Anyone have similar symptoms ever?",1
"Chest Hey guys i hope everyone is well! This weekend i had slight chest pain and difficulty breathing aswell as a stuffy blocked nose. It was after hours so my local GP (doctors surgery) was closed, meaning the next best thing was the ER..i heard about this deadly flu going around and got my ass straight to the ER as soon as i started feeling this. They did heart monitoring and blood sample as well as a chest x ray and said everything was clear and that it must just be an infection. I was prescribed amoxicillin (500mg) 4 a day, spread out evenly. I feel better in the sense that my chest isnt as breathless and my nose isnt as stuffy and im generally perkier but the chest pain is still there and im worried about it. What if its fluid in my lung or pneumonia? Its just bizarre that my flu-like symptoms have essentially gone in the past 40 hours after 2 days on antibiotics yet i still feel this uncomfortable, worrying chest! Any advice? ",1

"Arm aches/ symptoms on one side of body Hey guys. I posted here before in mid December about having numbness and weakness on the right side of my body. I went home after finals week and my stress level dramatically decreased as I realized how well I did in my classes and I was able to decompress while at home. I went on a ski trip with my family in the middle of the break, right after Christmas, and I felt no symptoms at any time during that trip. I felt fantastic. As I came home and started to prepare to go back to school, I started feeling anxious that I would fall down into the same anxiety rabbit hole again in the second semester, and gradually the weakness and numbness started to come back. Now that Iâ€™ve been back at school for 8 days and the anxiety has persisted (albeit less severe) Iâ€™m still feeling tightness in the right side of my neck and in my right leg, as well as weakness and numbness in my right limbs. The symptom that is scaring me though is that my right arm feels dead, and I have aches in my shoulder and upper arm that really change in severity depending on the time and on what my arm is doing or where it is.

I just feel so stupid about this. Itâ€™s following the same trends as it did last semester and that all went away when I stopped stressing. Now Iâ€™m stressing again, but for some reason my mind doesnâ€™t want to attribute this to the stress and I keep worrying that itâ€™s a horrible disease coming to claim my life. Anyone have any input on a situation like this?",1

"Horrid smelling dollar bill (smells like a dead animal[rabies anxiety]) A little background of myself. I have a severe phobia of rabies ever since I was bitten by a dog two years ago. Now every little thing triggers my fear. Anyways, today in the grocery store I received some money that smelled absolutely disgusting. The type of smell you smell from a rancid, dead animal. Now I've convinced myself that someone came into contact with a dead, rabid animal, didn't wash their hands, and smeared whatever gunk they picked up from the hypothetical animal onto the dollar bill that I touched.

"Lymph node anxiety Hi guys, long time lurker here. For about the past 6 months Iâ€™ve had my health anxiety under control, or at least I accepted the anxiety as it was.

Iâ€™m rather thin and theyâ€™re not terribly noticeable but if I feel around itâ€™s maybe a little smaller than the size of my thumb.

"My Health Anxiety Story and How I am Recovering Hello /r/HealthAnxiety!

Allow me to tell you my health anxiety story and how I am beginning to recover from this psychological illness!

The first precursor to my health anxiety was probably almost a year ago to the date when I felt a bump on my shoulder, which I thought was a tumor. Of course, it ended up being a deeply embedded pimple or cyst and resolved on its own after I went to the doctor who said the same thing. When I went into full-blown panic mode was back in April when I woke up with two puncture marks on my ankle after staying the night at a sister's house. Knowing that they once had an issue with a bat in the attic, I assumed that a magical bat had made its way all the way downstairs, embedded itself in the bowels of my sister's house, and bit me on the ankle. Of course, this magical bat must have had rabies too. Spoiler warning, but I did not die of rabies and am not writing this as a ghost.

My health anxiety probably climbed into a hysteria that consumed me last June. I was going to a university field station when I fell ill. Really ill. Not being able to keep down food or water for three days ill. Thus, I flew home as I had missed much of the class and assumed that I was going to die and wanted to so around family. Yet, again, I did not die, but the ordeal had traumatized me enough to sink into full-time paranoia that I would not escape until October.

Except for the occasional stomach ache things were fine for a month from a physical perspective, but from a mental perspective (if thinking I had terminal skin cancer from a 2mm mole was any indication) I was in rough shape. 

In mid-July, I developed the first sign of a rare birth defect that I did indeed end up having. Now, before you go into a google symptom, allow me to explain what happened: my belly button burst open. It was not painful as I didn't know this had occurred for an hour. It wasn't until I looked down and saw that my outie had turned into a popped inside outie. I walked to the hospital and was diagnosed with cellulitis and told to go to a follow-up with the university doctors. Ultrasound showed nothing. It was only after a CT scan two months later that they saw a 1""x2""x3"" sinus and cyst located behind and below my belly button. The operation was a success and it was removed two months ago. I even got an innie out of the ordeal. In between July and October I had been tested for just about anything and the only thing that came up were elevated liver enzymes and a weird-ass belly button.

In the meantime, I had begun CBT and doubled my dosage of Celexa (which is now down), which helped a lot. Besides teaching me mindful thinking, my therapist became a good outlet to just talk about life and my general grievances that I had been experiencing as a graduating senior from a top state university.

To err on the side of caution, my PCP sent me to a liver specialist to get my liver checked out. They tested me for any liver ailment you can think of, and the only weird thing was my beta globulins- ever so slightly out of range (think 0.1 out of range when usually 1 or 2 out of range indicates an actual problem). Wanting to be as thorough as possible, the pathologist recommended a Bence-Jones Test for leukemias myelomas, and pre-leukemia. The test came back negative. Specialist ruled that it was just an off result due to my immune system still recovering from surgery about two and a half weeks before and I had had no other symptoms consistently. This final test was taken after Christmas break and ordered before it so despite being told I did not have a deadly illness, I stewed over it.

And then, something happened. Something clicked in my head. I was sick of being prodded at and tested. I looked at my medical information logs for every time I visited the doctor and whenever I was with anyone but my PCP, my blood pressure jumped thirty points and pulse went up to 90bpm over 70. Living in America, I realized that doctors will NEVER stop running medical tests unless they are sure they have ruled out a condition. They don't want to get sued and if you have the insurance or money WILL run a test if you are insistent enough. This all hit me in about 24 hours. I decided that should that final test come back negative that I would only go to the doctor if anything were seriously and obviously wrong or for my psychiatric check-ups. I only google things five minutes a day and I do not talk to my doctors over the patient portal- only at appointments.

My status has improved tremendously these past two and a half weeks. I wanted to tell you guys that there is hope, and what you likely suffer from is a psychological issue. It really is. In seven months the only weird things they could find was:
-Elevated liver enzymes, likely prescription or slight fatty liver after a huge barrage of tests
-Maybe some gallbladder sludge/stone
-Weird-ass belly button thing where if you had it would be very obvious or already addressed in your childhood (having it through adulthood so unlikely that they like to write case studies on it)

And guess what? These were and are all very treatable. I came back here to post to tell you guys that it can get better. I felt a twinge in my upper right abdomen and got a little panicked tonight but this was the first time I felt even remotely worried about something in the last two weeks. I don't know if it'll take therapy, different meds, getting sick of tests, or all three, but you can get there. Don't give up.",1
"Possible Ear Infection? So my left ear is a bit red and itchy, it also feels like itâ€™s burning and itâ€™s tender to touch in certain places, especially just before the inside of the ear and behind the ear like the rounded bit on the outside.

I think it might be my earphones that have caused the problem so Iâ€™ve stopped using them for a couple days.

Iâ€™m not sure if this is something I should go to the doctor about or not. I know ear infections and stuff donâ€™t really need treated but I wasnâ€™t sure if I should just wait it out or go see a doctor about it. ",0
"Melanoma on Upper Back? I've been anxious my whole life about my health. However, it seems that I kill myself over nothing because, in the end, I had nothing. But now, something concerning appeared, a weird patch that is slightly darker than the rest and it isn't symmetrical. I just noticed this and I'm REALLY freaking out. I'm a minor and I don't know when I can schedule another doctors appointment. I've read that it can be extremely dangerous. I don't know what to do or how to handle my emotions right now.",1
"Random itchiness? Just looking for possibilities I guess, here's what happened:

I'm preparing to move by putting stuff into boxes, today I focused on decorations such as figurines around the house, military memorabilia, books, and small miscellaneous items. The only thing out of the ordinary was an old roommate's uniform that moved out like 6 months ago that was sitting under where I put my motorcycle helmet, I picked it up and unfurled it, saw it was his put it in my roommates pile of stuff. About 45 minutes later (give or take) my arms became itchy, incredibly itchy.

When I looked at it it looked like a rash all on one side of my forearm (basically exactly where the uniform touched) and then a couple of welt like spots a bit away. I washed my arms but a little bit after I was itchy on the middle of my back, shoulder, upper thighs, calves, ankles, chest, and stomach. I hopped immediately in the shower and changed clothes.

There is a chance it was old fuel on the uniform, I have a stuffed nose and can't smell a thing. My friend hasn't had a rash of any sort. Any thoughts?

FYI: I'm going to medical in the morning I just want thoughts now is all",0

"Struggling with hantavirus fear... I can't rationalize out of it Hi all.. Never posted here, but I've been struggling with health anxiety for about a year.

I'm just really scared  and anxious right now. I woke up yesterday with a cough which progressed to lung pain. I've never had lung pain, so I think that is where a lot of this fear is coming from. Last night I got a fever, and today I'm pretty sick. Fever, mild sore throat, productive cough, and pretty bad body aches.

See, I'm freaking out about hantavirus because two weeks ago, I dismantled a crappy structure in my sunroom where my dogs hang out. It was really, really dusty. So much dust. I didn't wear a mask or anything. I didn't see any mice or droppings or anything, but there was so much dust. To make matters worse, I live in New Mexico, where hantavirus is most common. I also live in a county where there was a case in 2016.

This just doesn't feel like my normal kind of sick. It started in my lungs, where usually when I get sick my first symptoms is a sore throat and stuffy nose. Now my nose is barely stuffy, but I have a really bad cough. It's been a long time since I've had a fever, and I can't recall getting muscle aches before this.

All the factors combined are freaking me out really bad. I live in the state it is most common, I cleaned out an enclosed space where there was lots of dust, and now two weeks later (within the incubation period) I came down with a sickness that I feel is unusual for me.

Someone please talk to me. I don't know what to do or how to get rid of this crazy fear I feel. I can't stop googling about hantavirus. I've been at it for hours, since I woke up today.",1
Hair fall So I've posted here before regarding my hair loss issue. I mentioned in my previous post that I have a very oily scalp and a lot of dandruff on my hair and as a result I have bald patches. Some people recommend me to see the doctor for second opinion so I visited another dermatologist today. She was able to diagnose my problem. She said I have a very severe hair loss at a very early age (I'm only 17). The problem she mentioned was androgenic alopecia. She said normally this problem is caused because of genetics but since none of my family members are bald it's probably due to an harmonal imbalance. So I'm wondering is there anyone who suffered from a similar problem and how did they manage to recover their hair?,0
"Always think I have cancer So I remember it started in high school where I started having a bump grow on a specific spot on my head and I never had any real fear before this time. I remember sitting in my class googling bump in that location and it said swollen lymph node which could be a sign of cancer. At first I was like ok no itâ€™s probably just a pimple but then two weeks after that I got another one on my head where another lymph node was supposed to be located. I was terrified and I thought this was it. I went to the doctors made them send me to specialists the whole 9 yards and they kept telling me thatâ€™s not a lymph node but I was convinced they had no idea what they were talking about because I read so many articles on google. Turns out they were just cysts. 

Since then that has sparked my fear of always thinking I had cancer. That was 3 years ago and since then I have been convinced I had bone cancer, brain cancer and now stomach cancer. 

I have been a heavy weed smoker for a while and I started to get a tightness and cramping pains in my stomach I associated with the weed. So I quit and 2 days after quitting I got really bad runs, I was nauseas, and I threw up a couple times. I lost 15 pounds during this period which was a feeder into yep itâ€™s cancer. The strange thing is when I stared getting better my symptoms only appeared in the morning. 

After this period I thought maybe it was just a sickness and not the weed so I smoked all day everyday again for another week but then started waking up nauseas so I quit again and again a couple days after quitting I got the runs. Itâ€™s been brutal and I have since gotten a lot better. Although my stomach still hasnâ€™t gone back to normal Iâ€™m now terrified every morning because thatâ€™s usually when I go the bathroom and I freak out I have stomach cancer. I wouldnâ€™t leave my doctor alone at the time and made her run so many tests and everything always came back fine. 

I just want to know how some people got over this irrational fear. Iâ€™m only 19 and on the cancer statistics website shows less than 1% of people who get this cancer are under 20 and most of them have a family history of it so my chances are very unlikely which I can understand but a part of me is still terrified. Thanks in advance! ",1
"How do you know when it's real or just anxiety? I have a problem where I want to get checked by doctors a lot, even when they say I'm fine, I try to insist they run more tests. I've heard of people who will often have stories like ""My cancer wasn't discovered at first by the doctors, but I had a gut feeling and insisted more tests, and then my cancer was found!"" So, I'm not sure when to give up and accept it's my healthy anxiety or if I should trust my gut and ask for more tests and exams. My doctors said I am too young for breast cancer (22) but it's still possible, right? I don't know when to give up or if I should look into it more. What do you guys do? How can you tell if it's real or not?",1
"Need Support ASAP for rabies fear!! So on January 4th (almost 2 weeks ago) I pet, and gently moved, a friendly cat out of the road by a local restaurant. He let me pick him up under one arm in my fluffy winter coat without too much resistance or fighting back, but darted off a little peturbed once I moved him. He may have lightly dug his claws in for balance and surprise at being moved- but as a germaphobe who is very afraid of cat scratch fever, I feel I would've noticed excessive claws making it through my winter layers.

I went about my night (my birthday night) without much else of a thought for the cat. The next morning I did discover a fair amount of dried bleeding and cut/scraped area on my elbow that I'm still not sure how it came to be. But again, I patched it up and went about my days. Its since healed fine. I wasn't intoxicated, but I had been out dancing late and thought maybe I bumped it at some point.

Fast forward to today, January 17th, and the talk of rabies comes up. Suddenly I remember the cat and mysterious scratch. Surely I would've known if the cat did It? He was friendly, docile, and clean. I figured he belonged to some one living in the city located nearby to the place we were eating at since he was chubby and had a soft clean coat. But now I'm freaked out! Should I talk to my Dr about getting a rabies shot now?! Its been 2 weeks on Saturday.

**I fully intend to call my Dr in the morning and have spoken to the nurse hotline. I just know they also kind of have to give me the ""just in case"" response and would like some more candid input**

"I'd been told it was just anxiety for two years, and now I've been diagnosed with a tumor I developed Panic Disorder when I was in college, shortly after the Virginia Tech Massacre. I was a freshman at Virginia Tech when it happened, and my sophomore year, I started to have deep-seeded health anxiety (fear of death, mostly.) I'd suffered through many family deaths before, and psychologists had told me I had PTSD with fear of dying. I DO have health anxiety, and I border on hypochondria. 

HOWEVER!

When you already have a PD diagnosis, or a hypochondria diagnosis, I find that doctors don't take you seriously. I completely understand why they wouldn't: it's tiresome for them when you come in and tell them you're having a heart attack when you're really suffering from GERD. When I first saw a doctor and told her that it felt like I'd broken my rib three times in one year, she sent me to a psychiatrist. The next doctor told me I needed to up my Prozac. Finally, a CT scan showed I have a severe Fibrous Dysplasia tumor in my 10th rib which is growing into my liver, kidney, and diaphragm. I'm scheduled for surgery on March 5th. 

It's hard to know when it's your health anxiety and when it's your health, and GOOD LORD it's tiring for us anxious people to convince doctors that we're having a real problem. I honestly still don't know how to tell the difference, but I'm here to say, SOMETIMES, your gut is right.

Anyone else have trouble with doctors writing them off because of their Anxiety or Hypochondria?",1
"Flu Fear! Oh boy. It's DEFINITELY that time of the year. The time of year to search all over the internet for articles on flu statistics and reading through the sad cases of people who were killed by it, and subsequently, sending yourself into a spiral of anxiety when you remember the fact that you did not get your flu shot this year.

I've never gotten the flu. I haven't gotten the shot in a few years too, I believe. My doctor asked me if I wanted it a few months ago, but I foolishly said no at the time because I was in a rush to leave. Boy, do I regret it now.
I go back to college in about 2 weeks, and I am stressed. I suppose it's not too late to go get it, but that doesn't quell my anxiety over the fact it's only 10% effective anyway. Jeez.

TLDR; I'm afraid I'm going to be one of those rare cases of someone dying of the flu. I need to stop reading. 
I'm hoping for some solidarity here. Does anyone else have this fear, especially considering this season is supposedly very bad?

"Hip still swollen 4 months after fall, anxiety about it hangs over me. About months ago I fell and landed on my hip. I stayed down for a minute or two only because I didn't think it would be a good idea to get up immediately, but then I got up and was fine. It was sore that night, but that was about it. The swelling started that night, too. Maybe a week and a half later, I went to the doctor about it. He didn't do any x-rays, but he felt around and tested my range of motion. My range of motion was fine and I didn't have any pain, and he said everything felt like normal swelling. He said it looked like the normal response to a fall, and that swelling can take 5 weeks to heal I think. So here I am, 17 weeks later, and my hip is still swollen. There was a moment where it hurt for a bit about 2 months ago, but that was only for a week or two. 

The anxiety about it hangs over me. It's always there as something that actually shouldn't be happening, something that to me is not easily explainable.",1
"Health anxiety due to unexplainable scars on face skin In late 2016 I went throught a very bad episode of depression and health anxiety which lasted a couple of months. Managed to tell myself that everything is alright and ignored all kind of twitches/pains that were temporary that use to bring anxious people like me a lot of bad thoughts.



Since around summer 2017 I started noticing small scars and little holes appearing on my face skin for no apparent reason. I have no acnee or other skin condition, I always had clear and clean skin. 



I went to a specialist and he couldnt put a diagnose, tested me for some anti-immune stuff which came out fine.



I'm trying to ignore it but every few days a new hole appears and its destroying my face a bit at a time. I think I will soon succumb to the thoughts and lose it again in front of health anxiety.



How do you people put up with apparently minor issues that bug you for long periods without knowing why it happens? Do you just go on about your life?",1

"Chest Pain Hello, I have been experiencing this random chest pain on the left and it has been very concerning for me. It started back in June 2017~ random pain that comes and goes and only last for like a few seconds or so. It happens sometimes near center of my chest to the left or upper left near shoulder. It also disappeared and stopped after a few months then came back again in October and disappeared again and came back again. I've been to the doctor and he said my heart beat was fine, blood pressure was fine, blood test turned out normal mostly just need a bit of exercise to lower fat. Doctor said it probably is muscle spasms but does it happen this often? It's getting really annoying and causes me to freak out sometimes.",0
"Just looking for some advice. First, a little backstory (sorry if a bit long). 

Up until last year I was an extremely sedentary 28yo weighing around 265 lbs. I started a new job that is fairly physical and since then I have dropped down to 230ish. Well last week I was laying down and felt something I never felt before in my chest. I went to the doctor and he said it was almost certainly my xiphoid process. I also mentioned I had a general cough (I us an e-cigarette), as well as a periodical tingle under my right shoulder-blade. Other than those three things I felt completely normal.

My doctor said everything felt normal, my blood pressure was normal, as was my pulse and he checked me out with a stethoscope. In the end he ordered an x-ray to be certain. From that appointment up until I got my results I started stressing out (tight chest, sweating, vomiting, trouble sleeping, just overall freaking out about what that x-ray might show). Low and behold I got my result and everything came back looking completely normal. Although that is great news I haven't been able to ditch the tight chest, trouble sleeping with bad thoughts, and general feeling of just being uncomfortable. I also wear a fitbit to work and constantly find myself checking my heart rate (between 59 when I sleep and 120ish when i'm up working).  

Sorry for the wall of text, I am just hoping someone here could give me some tips on managing this stress. I have a yearly physical next month that can't get here soon enough.

Thank you.",1

"I am avoidant I have been having muscle spasms and back pain for a little under a year. I have massive anxiety about doctors and phone calls and the health care in my region is not very good.

"Health anxiety vent :( My massive fear is getting pregnant. Every twinge I have, no matter what, is pregnancy. This all started from an increase in anxiety levels after (ironically) staring the birth control pill.

Itâ€™s been going on for months. No amount of doctors visits, home tests, visits to a sexual health nurse, not even having penetrative sex, or even a blood test has managed to completely calm me down. If it does it only lasts for a few hours. All I think is of women I read about on the internet who have been 8 months pregnant without any tests and still getting periods, or if Iâ€™m ectopic (my Mum nearly died from one of those).

Iâ€™ve had nexplanon put in my arm, but the stories online of women getting pregnant somehow overrule the data that says itâ€™s 99.9% effective/my nurse saying she wouldnâ€™t even do a test on me if I came in with nexplanon claiming to be pregnant. 

Iâ€™ve just started CBT and Iâ€™m on anti-depressants (citalopram, which I donâ€™t think is working after 5 weeks on 10mg). Iâ€™m just terrified that Iâ€™ll never get better, and Iâ€™ll have to leave my university and my boyfriend and friends in London and move home to my parents again (who I adore, but I never wanted to stay at home for uni. That would be a massive defeat for me).

Just needed to vent because Iâ€™m fkin terrified right now and all I can thing about is the pain Iâ€™m getting in my stomach, and if itâ€™s a baby kicking me.

"Stomach just WON'T stop acting up, on fire, etc. Would an MRI detect anything serious? I was sent to the hospital because my stomach was giving me immense trouble. They performed a colored MRI on me, but I'm still worried because I don't fully understand what it's supposed to detect. If they were looking for like some sort of bowel thing, would they have missed something like colon cancer or something serious? Does an MRI even detect stuff like that? They sent it to an outsourced radiology firm because they didn't have a radiologist on-site at night. 

The problem is my stomach still will NOT stop. It's acting up immensely. I've gotten over a lot of my health anxiety, to the point where I've been off meds but I had to take a pill today to relax. My family does think something's wrong as I'm always fatigued, pale, nauseous etc. I'm getting a full blood work panel done soon because my iron was extremely low some time ago so they wanna check again, also because diabetes runs in my family like crazy.

Couple with an MRI and a full blood work panel this Wednesday, what are the chances of them missing something?

"Paranoia and Anxiety about that Brain Eating Amoeba Hi everyone. I'm pretty new to this sub, but I really need to vent.

 I was diagnosed with Illness Anxiety Disorder two years ago and I generally have a pretty good hold of it. Yesterday, I was showering and a drop or two or water got into one nostril in my nose. I could feel it chilling in my nose hair and I immediately used my towel to wipe it out and then I blew my nose when I got out of the shower. However, I live in Florida, and I'm really paranoid that the brain eating amoeba is lurking in the water. This was water from the shower head in my dorm and it has been colder lately, but I can't get these thoughts out of my head. I'm terrified; I'm even tearing up with fear writing this. My birthday is next week and I want to be okay for that and for everything. My mom said I'm worrying needlessly and she's probably right but I can't shake the anxiety.

Edit to add: It doesn't help that symptoms apparently don't develop for 1-9 days after infection, so I'm going to be sitting in my anxiety for days.",1
"Deep scratch from unvaccinated cat Hey, so last night I got a deep scratch from a cat on my thumb. It was bleeding quite a bit until I cleaned it up and bandaged it.

My friend and his family have been scratched quite a bit by the cat as well (but not as of late). It's a house cat and rarely ever leaves the house.

"Constantly â€œcheckingâ€ for signs of brain problem Hey, guys. So this is a little difficult to explain, so hopefully I can describe it as cohesively as possible. So, a couple months ago I developed a little obsession with misreading things. I misread a couple of words and immediately began to think â€œthere is something wrong with my brainâ€. Well now, itâ€™s manifested itself in just about everything. In a bizarre way to prove I do/donâ€™t have a problem, Iâ€™ve begun subconsciously â€œcheckingâ€ every thing I read and hear to see if I made a mistake. For instance, Iâ€™ll skim a headline really fast online, then get frustrated when I misread it (even though I didnâ€™t carefully read it). Because Iâ€™m now â€œcheckingâ€ every single word I read and hear, Iâ€™m constantly misreading, mishearing and misunderstanding things, because Iâ€™m focusing on each individual word and not the sentence as a whole. Itâ€™s mentally exhausting and is effecting my reasoning skills and memory, which of course, is fueling my health anxiety as it further â€œprovesâ€ I have something wrong with me. 

Of course, occupying my mind with this causes me to make many, many mistakes which- you guessed it- fuels it more.

"Oral cancer fears It's been at least weeks since I've noticed it, but who knows how long it's actually been there. I'm not even sure how to describe the location. It's not on the hard palate but kind of in between that and the hard part of the gums on the inner side of teeth.

"Kind of freaking out now ('heavy' arm, sweating. nausea) I'm 26 years old, male, overweight (5' 10"" 250lb), non-smoker, infrequent drinker, non drug user, sedentary lifestyler, and my doctor has been monitoring my triglycerides for several years (I'm a carb addict). 

For the last several days I've been feeling kind of off. I've had what I think feel like low blood sugar episodes; light-headedness, feeling faint, slight nausea/abdominal discomfort that got better after I had some candy. 

I've also had feelings of 'fuzziness' in my hands and feet that come and go throughout the last several days. Not pins and needles or even a 'static' feeling, just 'fuzzy'.

Today, my left arm feels 'heavy'. That's the best way I can describe it. I seem to have normal strength in it and it's not numb anywhere, just 'heavy'. It's worth noting that I sleep on my sides (I switch sides several times throughout the night) and due to the way I position my arms, it's not uncommon for me to wake up with an arm asleep. Is it possible for a slept-on arm to retain an odd feeling for several hours after waking up?

Today, I had my favorite meal, mom's spaghetti. Once I got myself a serving, though, I found that I was lacking appetite. I began to feel kind of nauseous and began sweating. Nausea and sweating combined with the heavy arm freaked me out badly for a while. I took some pepto-bismol and don't really feel nauseous anymore, I'm not sweating anymore, but my arm still feels weird. I was pretty close to deciding to go to the ER for a little bit there, but I don't know. I think I'm going to make an appointment with my doctor for Monday.

"Nervous about pain in throat after eating garlic &amp; venting Hi everybody,

So Iâ€™ve been suffering from health anxiety for about 4 years now. It all started with a donkey biting my arm while on vacation. Since then, Iâ€™ve had the rabies shots twice. I go to my doctor many times a year. Iâ€™ve developed a chronic pain on my shoulder. And I pretty much freak out over every little symptom.

Last night my mom called me to tell me she was coming down with a cold. I remembered that yesterday I borrowed her scarf and used it all day. Wanting to prevent a cold, I crushed a raw garlic clove and ate it. Iâ€™ve done this before many times and normally it just gives me a little acid reflux. Iâ€™ve noticed that raw garlic keeps me pretty healthy overall. However, this time, I developed a burning sensation in my throat about fives minutes after I ate it. It has now been burning me for about 6 hours. I woke up in the middle of the night and have not been able to go back to sleep. I had some milk and a banana and took ibuprofen to see if it would help the pain/burning sensation. Even my chest started hurting, which never usually happens to me. 

Iâ€™m embarrassed to go to the hospital for just a stupid raw garlic but my mind is going there and Iâ€™m already catastrophizing everything (ie Iâ€™ve burned a hole through my throat, this will somehow lead to death, etc). Iâ€™m hoping the symptoms  go down within the next couple of hours, otherwise, the pain will get the better of me and I might actually go to the emergency room.

In times like these I hate myself and how miserable I make life for myself. Why canâ€™t I just get over these dumb fears? If I wasnâ€™t so afraid all the time, I wouldnâ€™t have eaten the garlic. My anxiety and negative thinking is probably making my pain and symptoms worse (Iâ€™m an expert at that).

Iâ€™m just really tired of constantly being in pain for some reason or another. This sucks. :(",1
"I'm convinced I have HIV. I've had a bit of HIV-phobia for a while now, and I realize now it was (mostly) unfounded. But this summer it got worse. I have no job right now and I wasn't going to school, so I spent most of the summer inside, to an unhealthy extent. When I did go out for long enough, I developed a rash that I think is PMLE, which is a mild allergy to sunlight, not fun but harmless. Then I saw that it can be a symptom of HIV infection. Granted, I've never had this reaction before. The page said it can develop around my age, and near-nonexistent sun exposure mixed with periods of high exposure can probably cause reactions like that, especially since it was a pretty brutal summer, but I'm still terrified.

Around this time I also started to develop these purplish vein-like patterns on my legs, and that just made me panic even more because I couldn't just explain that away. I am overweight, and I think I gained some weight during the summer, so I thought of stretch marks, but aren't those usually white? They seem to be going away now but that's only a little comforting.

I've never done drugs or even had sex. But I remember finding an unexplained cut on my finger a few years ago that I'm afraid might have been from a needle in the trash where I worked at the time. I don't remember exactly when that happened. I haven't been getting sick often or having issues with infections, but would I really notice those things if my immune system wasn't working properly? Isn't the immune system where most of the symptoms come from?

I still haven't been going out as much as I probably should, and I realize that I probably have a severe vitamin D deficiency, so that might be causing some of this, but I don't know if it can explain everything. I keep checking my skin for any changes, fearing the worst. I'm really scared.",1
"Really bad health anxiety at night Some background... I was diagnosed with OCD in the third grade, but was suspected of having it long before that. I have bad intrusive thoughts. I've been in and out of therapy for many years. 

Within the past few years my health anxiety has gotten bad again, like it was when I was a child. In late 2016, when I was 19, I went through a phase where I thought I was dying Every. Single. Night. I ended up having so many panic attacks and losing a lot of friends. I lost over 60 pounds in like 2-3 months. I got into a relationship on the tail end of this breakdown and am still with my partner. It helped a lot and continues to help.

Now, like a year and a half later, it's not as bad as it was in that period, but the symptoms linger still. I haven't had a checkup since a little before the breakdown in 2016. I'll go to the doctor if I catch a cold or whatever but not for a checkup.

Now....this is because I'm like, terrified that I'll find out that I have a terminal illness. Cancer, of any type, kidney failure, some kind of disease... whatever, it doesn't matter. Whenever I think about it I freak out and get nauseous and scared. When I'm laying in bed at night I will feel my boobs for lumps, and always convince myself something is there when it isn't, in different parts of my boobs. I've gotten to a point where I dont even like touching them.

"paranoid about testicles and now I'm freaking out So I'm totally serious here and I know it sounds like I'm trying to be funny but I'm not! A week ago  I was lazy and didn't do laundry so I went commando for pretty much a week. Because of how ""loose"" it was down there I became more aware of my testicles and would reach down there more often. Anyways, because I was constantly reaching down there I became paranoid about my testicles. 

I should also note that I was a frequent fapper (like 3-4 times a day) and decided to stop that. So I would go nofap for 2 days and then have a go at it once the next day. Then again 2 days not and then on the 3rd day have a go at it. I started this 2 weeks ago and last week I felt a little ""pinch"" on my left testicle. It didn't hurt or anything it was just... uncomfortable but went away fairly quickly but that feeling only heightened my paranoia!!

I haven't felt that feeling since but I keep thinking about it and now I keep imagining I do have that feeling again.  I always constantly reach down there feeling them, and thinking omg one is bigger than the other! omg one feels softer than the other! I'm dying!

I want to go to the doctor but I also have a fear of doctors! I can't sleep. I'm undereating. I sometimes cry at night. I was never like this and I hate it. 

Last year I was paranoid about my neck which took me a while to get over and now it's below the belt. I just want to live my life normally again. ",1
"Just venting a bit... Hello guys. 

For the past month or so Iâ€™ve been dealing with daily stress from thinking I have something. It started out with weakness and fatigue and stomach and stool issues which I attributed to colorectal cancer. After multiple blood tests and ct scans that found nothing, I made the mistake of looking up my symptoms on doctor google and found als. Ever since (this was early Jan) Iâ€™ve been over analyzing every â€œsymptomâ€ I have and havenâ€™t had real peace of mind. Itâ€™s taken a huge toll on me mentally and I plan to get help. Iâ€™m the last 3 weeks Iâ€™ve gone from having twitches all over to burning in my arms to twitching in my hand and now what looks like atrophy in my thenar muscles. I am scared and I just wanted to get it off my chest since my neuro referral wonâ€™t come for like another month.

Things I have going for me:

1: I am a 23 year old Hispanic male and statistically less probable to get the disease
2: my twitches are widespread, which is uncommon in als. Only recently have they been in my right hand more focused.
3: the â€œlack of strengthâ€ I originally felt isnâ€™t there anymore, nor am I dropping things or have any strength loss that I can see
4: I have gotten back into the gym and can lift things comfortably and well. 
5: no family history of neuro diseases
6: this has been going on for a month without affecting my life (other than mentally)

Things I worry about:

1: My right hand palm has some visible dents and lines that I feel have gotten more pronounced. This has not resulted in weakness but they seem to have gotten worse. Iâ€™ve googled a lot of pictures and compared to friends and family and I havent found any that look like mine. All Iâ€™ve found are clearly atrophied which at that point is completely obvious and donâ€™t look like mine. Mine look as though Iâ€™m missing muscle strips and crevices.

2: on the same right hand, the thenar muscles have begun twitching as of 5 days ago. My index finger especially will twitch and jump on its own. Also my right thumb/hand is less flexible than my left.

"Ex-Smoker, Fear, and Excessive Research Hi everyone.

As a health anxiety sufferer, I have an interesting story to share.

A few years ago, I picked up a habit of smoking hookah. I smoked cigars for a bit as well, throughout the same period.

I smoked hookah probably between 100 and 200 times in all.

Once I left my masters program, a few years later I felt a pain in my back. This was my first bout with health anxiety. I couldn't figure out what was causing it, so Googling symptoms led me to lung cancer.

I thought, ""I smoked, so it could be true."" Then I saw this awful number online: Hookah = 100 Cigarettes, according to various news organizations, citing the WHO.

This terrified me. I smoked the equivalent of FIVE PACKS every time I smoked?!

Of course, eventually I found out that lung cancer was not the case. It was a messed up nerve. Physical therapy and some posture fixes, and that particular back pain is more under control. (I also have chronic back pain, I believe as a result of anxiety and a lack of movement.)

Fast forward a few years.

At the beginning of this year, I started having a high level of health anxiety after visiting the dermatologist and having some moles removed. (They were dysplastic nevuses - he removed them, but honestly probably didn't even need to.)

I started freaking out about melanoma, but when I realized I could relatively well see and manage that if it were to happen, as long as I stay vigilant about skin checks and doc checkups, melanoma is not a big threat.

But then the lung cancer scare came back.

I frantically tried to understand how much damage had I done. Pack years - how many do I have? 1? 5? 10?

I've read probably 100 different studies, done a thousand google searches, to understand the connection between hookah smoking and lung cancer.

Long story short, this led me down a path of compulsively studying. I also went back and reconstructed my year of smoking - down to the day-by-day level. I've requested transaction logs from my bank to see when I was in a particular place - when COULD I have smoked?

Some of this was actually helpful. I narrowed down my smoking to a possible 215 days, many of which I likely didn't smoke anyway. So I shrunk that fear a bit by looking at the reality.

Some of the other research I did was helpful, too - looking into the claim of 100-cigarette equivalence revealed that the number stated is referring to the volume of smoke, not necessarily the equivalence of hazard. I can't take a solid guess as to a better number, but the research I've read looks like much less than 100 for an average session.

Lastly, a lot of this research was NOT helpful, as my interpretation of the research caused me to catastrophize it.

My setup is a perfect example of what would drive a health anxiety sufferer insane: Reason to believe that something bad could happen (my short-lived smoking habit), ambiguity on the risk (very little research on hookah and its impact on your health), lots of scary media surrounding smoking, and finally my dodgy memory of how often and how much I smoked during that year.

This is a perfect recipe for fear for a health anxiety sufferer.

My wife and I had our first son last year. All of this fear has grown into a tragic story where my son loses his father at a young age because his father smoked hookah for a year. This all sounds silly from the outside, but completely plausible from the inside.

I want to encourage health anxiety sufferers who have analytical brains like me: focus on what is in front of you today. There is nothing you can do to change what happened yesterday. Be aware, but don't ruminate. Look for actions you can take today to be healthy, not reasons why you aren't healthy.

I'm learning that no matter what risk levels I have, there is nothing I can do to nail that down perfectly, and trying to nail it down keeps rumination and negative thoughts constantly in my head. The what-if questions stay present. The hyperfocusing on what my shortened life would look like - that pervades my mental state.

Now, today, is the day where I look at what I have and say ""thank you"" for it. Look at my past, and accept it. Look at my risk, and accept it. Look at the future with belief and hope for the best, rather than constantly fearing the worst.",1

"Possible rabies exposure? We have a problem with animals getting into our trash, one of the wonderful perks of living so close to the woods.

"scared I have P.O.T.S., are my heart rates abnormal? So at the moment I'm scared I have POTS, where your heart rate goes way high upon standing.

So I tried again, this time I sat down for 5 minutes, my heart rate was 78. Stood up and it went to 102, waited 10 minutes this time and it was about the same, maybe a little higher to 108.


And none of this is walking around or anything, didn't check that but no doubt it would be higher.

"Kind of freaking out because of mild night sweats Iâ€™m a healthy 18 y/o male that probably has anxiety issues including health anxiety. Iâ€™ve never seen a doctor specifically for it because it has never really gotten in the way of my life, just occasionally my head. Anyway, Iâ€™ve been experiencing some mild night sweats the past couple days. I wake up an hour or two after going to sleep and my shirt is generally damp. Itâ€™s not enough sweating to change sheets or anything, but sometimes I have to remove my shirt. Iâ€™ve had on and off night sweats in the past that freaked me out, such as last winter when I almost convinced myself I had some type of cancer because, well, a quick search on google led me to Mayo Clinic and... I think you can get the rest (this might have been a good time to see a doctor about anxiety...). Also, I had some mild night sweats for a while last month, but after I returned home from college they miraculously stopped. Last night was particularly bad in that my shirt was definitely soaked when I woke up in the middle of the night, but I just took it off and after stressing over it for a couple minutes, got myself to go back to sleep, and woke up with no more sweat. I should emphasize that when I really wake up, like in the morning, I do not wake up sweating. Should I be concerned about this, given that Iâ€™ve had them occasionally before, probably when I was really stressed out with school, and that theyâ€™re pretty mild? I donâ€™t want to ignore it if it could be a sign of something bad, but I want to stop freaking out about it, too. Again, these are not bed-drenching like google says is a problem. Oh and to make things even more annoying, I feel like Iâ€™m coming down with a cold or something... everyone in my school it seems is getting sick. So throw those symptoms together and you have an overly anxious kid. Thanks for any advice.",1

"I feel like my psychologist might be ready to refer me elsewhere I have OCD with a health anxiety emphasis. My worries have run the gamut but I mostly focus on the idea of skin cancer. I have been seeing a psychologist for CBT and while in the sessions everything he says sounds logical and makes perfect sense. However, the second I encounter a mole I feel looks suspicious I don't apply what I've learned in therapy and I do everything wrong. I start by googling my symptoms and then when that doesn't work, I go to my doctor to seek reassurance. This assuages my fears temporarily but sometimes its not enough until the doctor will agree to a biopsy. Then inevitably the cycle continues.

My psychologist has been doing this therapy with me for months and I was doing so well until I tried testing myself and found a new mole. I was definitely not ready for it and this started a downward spiral where I feel like all the progress I made went by the wayside and I was back to how I was in the beginning.

Today I had a session after my most recent urgent care &amp; doctor visit. The tone was a lot different this time and I can tell he's frustrated with me because I am not using his advice. He kept saying, ""I am sorry that I haven't been able to get through to you to help you."" and has pointed out that I am not doing the work of not giving into my compulsions. He said that he didn't want to make me go through therapy if I wasn't motivated to do the work to get better. He's totally right. 


The positive that came out of this is that I am reflecting on my lack of motivation to do what I know I need to do to get better. I feel like I can prove myself to him from this point forward but I don't know that he's willing to continue treating me. Hopefully this next appointment isn't him telling me its the last one.

"My HIV hypochondria is acting up again ðŸ˜ Hey guys,
So I had been sleeping with this guy (Rob) on and off since 2016 and around August last year I started to get anxious about his status after stalking his exes facebook. I noticed she had cold sores on her lips and the last time I saw her in 2015 I saw her with cold sores. At first I thought it was normal because lots of people have and get cold sores but when I saw a recent picture of her on Facebook with the same if not worse cold sores. This concerned me because to my knowledge only people who are immuno compromised get recurring cold sores that often. 
I had spoken to Rob about his status earlier and he assured me he was healthy and I chose to believe him but after speaking to one of my girl friends she was surprised at how quick I was to believe him. She said verbatim ""guys can lie and I don't trust these uni boys"" - keep in mind I live in Kenya where HIV is prevalent. This comment really freaked me out and I was sure he lied to me. 
I started freaking out and going crazy because of the picture of his ex coupled with my friend's comments, I was sure I had contracted the virus. At this time I started sending him cryptic messages alluding to him infecting me but he didn't get which then forced me to plainly ask ""Are you HIV positive?"" He quickly replied ""No I'm not. I checked, you also checked"" and I went and got tested and my results returned negative (this wasn't a rapid test it was the one you wait two days for). 
I felt so bad about accusing him and we stopped speaking. 
Skip forward 3 months and we start fucking again. We met up and fucked 2 more times before I officially ended it for good. Now my mind is going back to thoughts that I'm HIV positive again. I keep thinking that maybe the first 6 times we met up and fucked the virus missed me and on the last 7th and 8th time the virus may have stuck. Is that possible? 

**TLDR** Had been hooking up with a guy since Dec 2016 and started getting anxious about his HIV status. Got tested in August 2017 and results came back negative. Started fucking him again in October 2017 and stopped in November. Is it possible that he is positive and the virus missed me the first 6 times we fucked and got me the last two times we did it? ",1

"Is it normal to get screened for psychosis even though I dont have any symptoms of it??? Ok, let me explain what is going on. Hope some of you can relate to this. My anxiety is through the roof.

Couple of years back I had stress-induced panic anxiety, with all the classic symptoms (rapid heartbeat, crazy tensions, panic attacks, fatique etc.). My doctor had a hard time telling me what was going on, and I kept coming to the worst conclusions -&gt; this gave me some crazy health anxiety and the fear of dying. I came over this in a year, and haven't had any of this for 2 years straight.

Now, 4 months ago I start to feel a little depressed, nothing major, I assumed it was due to the winter coming, messed up sleeping pattern and life just being a bit boring. This threw me right back into the health anxiety. Thoughts racing constantly about why I got depressed, what is happening to me, am I going crazy etc. I went to the doctor, saying that I felt off, a bit emotionally numb, and racing thoughts 24/7. I took a depression test there, but kinda showed nothing, so the doctor kept asking me questions about hallucinations and delusions, which I have had nothing of, never. I went back a couple of more times assuming something physical was wrong with me or atleast something crazy that messed with my cognitive abilities. Got the same questions again and again.

So I slowly started thinking about the questions, what if I am gonna hallucinate, see stuff that isnt there etc. Now I am stuck here with some 24/7 dp/dr, constant hyperawareness and crazy anxiety about hallucinating or going psychotic or something. It's like my brain is in super defence mode, recognizing everything that changes in my surroundings, telling me to reality check everything so I am sure that I am not going crazy. I feel so off.

I went to my doctor again and told her about the fear of going crazy or developing schizophrenia. And she sent me to a psyciatrist, with the reference of me being psychotic. When I read the reference I had a fullblown panic attack, I just froze. This made my anxiety 100x worse than before, thinking that I must be super crazy.

Recently I went to the psyciatrist who asked me the same questions about delusions and halluciations, and I described again the same things. That I've never had them, never had any delusions. But I am starting to think whenever I see something, delusional thoughts pop up in my head, because of my obsession about the fear: ""what if I thought someone were actually following me"" etc.. all kinds of intruisive thoughts that I know for a fact that is no were near real, but just scary that that they pop up in my head all the damn time. I used some metaphors there at the interview and I think she might have gotten the totally wrong idea of what I told her. Because now I am being sent off to an interview about schizophrenia and psychosis, because she thinks I am that apparently, even though I don't have any symptoms at all. She even gave me a temporary diagnosis as a schizophrenic wtf.

This is throwing me off, what the f is happening. Am I losing control, I can't believe this is happening. Is this normal to get screened for??? I feel so detatched right now, stuck in full blown overanalyzing mode of my surroundings, I can't relax. What if I am going schizophrenic or psycotic????

Sorry for my grammar my anxiety has never been worse.",1
"Can 24/7 anxiety cause brain-Tumor like symptoms? 19Yo male here, I eat really healthy and exercise regularly everyday just to preface.

Aside from this my life has been filled with death, my father is terminally Ill, my mum was suicidal and almost died of blood poisoning, my grandma had vascular dementia and we cared for her at home until her death, more beyond this, grandparents, friends' parents, uncles and aunts.

My anxiety since starting uni has worsened, I suffer an elevated heart rate and sweats 24/7, extreme worrying thoughts all the time, trembling hands, especially bad at night. 

I've not had any memory issues or coordination issues, it's literally just headaches, for the past few weeks I've been getting pain in very singular spots, never a full over generalised headache, it lasts for a few seconds to a minute and then disappears, and this happens a few times through the day. 
The kicker is if I CAN remove myself from my anxiety it doesn't really happen, I was shopping all of yesterday with my girlfriend and didnt have any issues at all until we got into a quiet taxi, at which point my thoughts went rampant.

I just feel like my anxiety is killing me, and it's really spearheaded into this fear of a tumor. I sleep awfully too because of my anxiety and grind my teeth severely, as well as holding my shoulders up and tight all the time. 

EVERY rational part of me says it's all a mental thing, but I cannot get that rational part of my brain to win over, I'm in constant states of terror and get these huge adrenaline rushes physically crashing over me daily.

Should I see a doctor? Should I be hugely worried from the point of view of a Tumour? I've finally after years managed to bring myself to see a therapist, I start next week, I've  just always felt myself as being a drama queen, but my life isn't even enjoyable anymore, I'm so sickly worried all the time. Thanks 

Edit; my mum also suffers from severe anxiety and depression, not sure if this has an impact, my dad is due for huge open heart surgery this year, could it be affecting my subconscious? Table death rate is quite high.",1
"Never ending cold/flu I'm sooo tired of being sick!
Since december, my health dropped. I had a really stressful semester, and when it was done, I got sick. Like a cold. Then it was fine for like a week, and then another cold that felt more like a flu, but not quite it. A big big cold. And a week later, today, I have the flu, I think. I'm coughing like crazy, my lungs hurt and now fever. Crazy headache.
It's just like my body hates me! I don't know what to do except venting. It's really not nice, I feel like a pile of poo right now. It's never ending!",0

"Sharp headache everytime I move or cough Figured I could come here for enlightenment since I'm currently kind of on holiday. I'm 23, female, and about a month ago I contracted one of the worst flus I'd ever experienced in my life - in fact I'm pretty sure I've never gotten any kind of flu before this one, I'm almost never sick. 

I only fully recovered about a week or two ago, and I've noticed for the past few days a sharp pain on the top of my head everytime I cough or move/change elevation. I figured it may be because I've been sleeping a lot and not drinking enough water perhaps, but I don't know. I took a pain killer a few days ago for the same kind of headache but it didn't help. Naps make it go away but not fully, I can still feel some kind of pressure/light pain when coughing and moving. I'm also currently on my period, which started a few days ago. Not sure if there's any correlation. Is this normal after a flu and a somewhat consistent cough? I haven't really gotten out of the house much the last couple of days either. Maybe I should?

One notable thing in my medical history (that I still have I believe) is iron deficiency. Not sure if that could also be a testament to whatever this is.",0
"Wheezing / constricted airways after exercising in the cold I've been doing the Couch-to-5K running program for about a month.  It's been in the 40s and 50s a lot lately when I go running.  I'm able to complete my runs fine, but I notice after getting home that the deepest parts of my lungs feel tight or constricted.  I can force a deep breath, but when I do I hear this wheezing like the airways are stretching back open.  Usually after about 30 - 60 min or so it's back to normal.

I tried wearing a neck gaiter after the first time and it got a lot better, but was still there.  I went to the doctor and described all this and he listened to my lungs.  He said my lungs sounded perfect.  And that it's normal to have that wheezing after exercising in the cold, since your airways constrict and forcing them open creates a spasm that makes that wheezing sound.  He also said as long as it's only that and not actual shortness of breath, then it's nothing to worry about and to continue running (preferably when it stops being cold).

Anyway - just wondering if anyone else can relate to this or can offer any other support.  It is an irrational thing at this point, since I've been to the doctor and described exactly what was going on to him.  Knowing the way my anxiety works, I suspect the reasons I haven't dropped it are that he didn't hear it actually doing it (and to me it sounds strange) and that I secretly worry it's a small start to a bigger lung issue (I've had a couple relatives pass away after getting pulmonary fibrosis - which definitely is in my head when anything lung-related is going on).  Any tips or other support would be fantastic!

PS - I refuse to google it (or anything else for that matter) but if anyone has support for pulmonary fibrosis worries that would help too.  I believe for my relatives that started with gradually dropping oxygen levels and some strange sounds the doctors could hear in their breathing.  So nothing like what I'm describing here .. if only health anxiety used the rational side of the brain!",1

"Hantavirus anxiety Hello folks. 

I am trying to ease some of my fear of hantavirus. I work in a place that does have a deer mice presence. Recently I went into a utility closet to grab a dolly. I noticed rodent droppings on the floor. I didn't mess with them at all but I did definitely breathe while I was in there. Does anyone have any understand of hantavirus on a deeper level? I know it is extremely rare and caused by kicking up dust that has been contaminated. But what are the odds that I get hantavirus assuming the mouse excrement in that closet was even infectious?

About every month something feels wrong with me and I freak out.  Sometimes it is just something normal that I wasnt previously aware of, but now that I am aware of it I feel like something wrong

"Scared about temporal arteritis Adding to all the cancers and heart conditions I've been worried about, I just read about temporal arteritis and I'm worried about it too. I'm a 23 year old white male. For the past couple days I've had tenderness near my right temple only. There's no constant pain, but it hurts when I put mild to moderate pressure on a certain part of the bone behind/under the temple. I can feel a slight bump there but there's an essentially symmetrical one on the other side (with no tenderness with the same amount of pressure). I do have many other symptoms of temporal arteritis, including frequent headaches (although generally mild), tiredness in limbs, and general tiredness, but I've had all that for a long time and often can be traced to specific causes like poor sleeping habits and dehydration. I don't have any of the jaw pain or tiredness (any more so than I would normally get after chewing for a long time anyway), although sometimes my mouth does feel slightly stiff if I haven't opened it for a while. I do have a bad habit of clenching/grinding my teeth that I've had for most of my life, and I've had TMJ-associated pain before. I don't *think* I've had any vision loss, but sometimes I do find it harder to focus or I feel like I'm not seeing quite as well when I' tired so I can't say for sure. I don't have any other tender points on my scalp, just the right temple.",1

"Is this health anxiety? Hi.

To start off for the past few months, i've been fucking worrying about my mouth. *All started with a load of canker sores in my mouth.*

I recently quit using chewing tobacco, and i have a feeling it stems from that.

I always worry about my mouth, for example..

I check my mouth to make sure everything is okay.

...

Everything going go-

OHGODWHATTHEFUCKISTHAT??

*Insert hours of worrying and pacing*

Another example, i was out in the garage and had an urge to check a mirror quick, noticed something on the roof of my mouth.

*insert the hugest adrenaline rush ever once i noticed it.*

I thought that was the end for me, i instantly messaged my mother at like 2 in the morning fucking shaking.

Why is this happening? Even the littlest thing in my mouth worries me to no end, and i'm sick of it. I have this feeling there is something wrong with my mouth, but whenever i post pictures of the ""problem"" on dentistry i realized how stupid it was.

"Anxiety or genuine heart condition? For the past year or so I have had crippling health anxiety, with it all being related to my heart. The anxiety comes in waves and is usually when I am on my own and not keeping myself busy. The symptoms are so raw and debilitating that I sometimes genuinely think I have a undiagnosed heart condition. Common symptoms include the following:

- Floating/sinking chest feeling

- Sudden twinges and sharp pierces that go after 1/2 seconds 

- Increase in heart rate

- Cold shivers 

- Restlessness (have to get up and walk around)

- Panic attacks

- Strange tingling an aching that is always on the left side of chest and resonates to left arm  and shoulder blade

- Dizziness/lightheadednesss 


I have recently taken up running as a form of exercise three times a week to aid in the alleviation of these symptoms. More often than not, this gives miraculous results and I feel fantastic after every run. Occasionally however, the anxiety kicks in half way through the run and it is a real struggle to continue. Afterwards I have to sit down and try not to panic and think that my heart is going to give out on me. 

Is there anything I can do to combat this anxiety? I am planning to get a blood test and ECG done just to rule out any conditions. I am a 22 y/o male with no family history of heart conditions.

That Monday I woke up in the middle of the night sweating, hungry and cold. I was pacing back and forth and I started googling my symptoms (I know, bad idea) and I came across peripheral neuropathy. I googled the causes of that MS was one of the results and I started to freak out.

I also feel like cold electricity going up the back of my head I I'ven really anxious ever since and it's started to affect me.

"Struggling with fear of breast cancer after seeing multiple doctors. Feeling lost. Hello everyone! This sub has been a great source of comfort for me for quite some time now. I have never felt the need to post until today as the last month has been very hard on me and I'm hoping someone will have some ideas on how I can combat my extreme health anxiety.

As a preface, Iâ€™m a 24 year old woman.

About a month ago, I felt a giant white welt under my left breast. The next day, it was no longer raised completely, but there was a slight bump like a pimple or a bug bite, but there was no 'peak'. It was red in the area, about the size of a quarter. No pain, no itching. I don't think I would have noticed it if I hadn't felt it. I have always struggled with health anxiety but for the past 6 months it has been pretty dormant. Then I googled 'bug bite on breast' and everything spiraled from there.

I stumbled upon Inflammatory Breast Cancer and am now convinced that I have it. I read multiple stories about how it is commonly misdiagnosed as a bug-bite (my doctor said it was a bug bite when I went in). This made my anxiety worse. So I saw another doctor at the family practice I go to. She wasn't sure what it was, it could be a pimple/skin irritation, and told me if it was still there in 2 weeks she would send me to a breast specialist.

I made an appointment with a breast specialist on my own because I could not bear the wait. He looked at it and told me it is most likely just a skin irritation from my bra or a clogged pore that is taking a while to heal. Said if it didn't go away in another 2-3 weeks that he would send me for an ultrasound but he really didnâ€™t think it was anything to worry about.

Again, this was not enough for me. I made an appointment with my OBGYN and he looked at it and echoed the same sentiment the other doctors did. It is nothing, whatever it was is on its way to healing. But he would send me for an ultrasound to set my mind at ease.

I got the ultrasound yesterday and they didnâ€™t find anything. They said there is a chance it was a tiny cyst that is now almost gone that it is undetectable on the machine. This should have made me feel better but I read online that IBC is very hard to detect on ultrasounds. If it didnâ€™t go away in two weeks, the radiologist told me I should see a dermatologist because it seems to be more of a skin issue. 

That day, I called to make an appointment with a derm because I know it takes time to get in to see them. Funnily enough, they had a cancellation that day and asked if I wanted to come in that afternoon. Of course, I said yes. 

When I was there, I explained my issues. The derm looked at it and again, said the same thing everyone else did. Itâ€™s most likely just a skin irritation and she gave me the option of waiting to see if it goes away on its own within 2-3 months or she could do a shave biopsy. I, of course, opted for the biopsy.

Then I got home and did more research and found out IBC is usually only diagnosed through a punch biopsy. The biopsy I got at the derm will not be deep enough to diagnose that even if it is there.

I cannot catch my breath and am struggling to function like a normal human being. Itâ€™s much more likely that the spot under my breast is just what everyone says it is; an irritation!!! IBC is SO rare, especially for someone my age, but itâ€™s the deadliness of the disease that is haunting my every move. I am so terrified of death and of dying young and leaving behind everyone I love.

I am on 10mg Buspar and have been for only a month now. The side effects are crippling me. I am only sleeping 3-4 hours a night, Iâ€™m having horrible nightmares, dizziness, headaches. I am not eating and have lost 15 pounds this month because of it. I cry hysterically almost every night. I obsessively check my boobs, whether that is starting at them in the mirror or prodding them or comparing them (the left one is bigger than the right, always has been â€“ but my health anxiety makes me wonder if it really has always been this way).

Every new spot I discover or mark or freckle sends me into extreme panic. Iâ€™m struggling to meet deadlines at work. Iâ€™m letting my house go to shit. 


 I just started therapy last week so I am hoping that eventually starts to kick in and help as well.

I guess what Iâ€™m looking for is advice on how to calm my nerves. How to function like a normal human being. Iâ€™m so depressed. Iâ€™m missing out on so much. 

Any words of advice would be so appreciated.

"Fear of TIA To preface this I have a long history with hypochondria, I have for years and it was getting better but recently it's been worse. I haven't had the outbursts I used to have but I guess that's because I keep it to myself 

Basically after walking home today I sat down and watched my laptop on my bed as I usually do, and my mum called, but when speaking to her it felt like I couldn't get the right word out, constantly mixing up my words and such, and she was asking basic questions about the day 

Of course this lead to google and then the whole ""mini-stroke"" and it's just scary honestly. I didn't have any muscle weakness but I have a mild tension headache now (pretty sure it was brought on by the stress) 

I'm 16 if that helps. I know I'm making something out of probably nothing but that's just me ",1
Convinced myself I have a peritonsillar abscess and will need surgery to remove tonsils because I wonâ€™t be able to get it drained. I have a sore throat. Itâ€™s only on one side.

Parasites from Africa (Bilharzia) I've always had health anxiety and now I'm a little freaked out after it turns out I have tested positive for Bilharzia after swimming in Africa a few years ago.  It says it can potentially damage bladder and genitals...my doctors don't seem to know much about it and aren't too worried.  Are there tests that can see if there is any damage such as scarring to male genital tract?  I know there are tests for the bladder but not sure if it is worth getting all this checked out now that the parasite is gone,1
"Something getting an infection obsession?? I have multiple piercings, and every time I get a new one they become infected, I think, I have a very bad problem with picking at EVERYTHING including skin, hair, face, nails and especially piercings, Iâ€™m constantly obsessing over them and stress theyâ€™re coming with infection 24/7
Then after I got my belly done. 
I got an actual infection, the top hole is red and yellow/white oozes out if I press it, Iâ€™m so stressed and have been caring for it like itâ€™s new, salt water and soaks ect.

Tw self harm:

I have been self harming for years but it has now gotten worse to the point Iâ€™m scarring and they can see fat in most cuts, because of my picking problem this has become so high stress as I donâ€™t want to get an infection and I constantly have to check them to make sure theyâ€™re not going sour, I think my left leg has multiple that are going bad but I canâ€™t trust my own judgement and Iâ€™m going crazy trying to inspect everything every second ",1

I canâ€™t tell if thereâ€™s a lump or anything but the pain scares me. It really is sore and like a 6 on pain scale. Everything Iâ€™ve read is saying get it checked it out and could be cancerous.

"Terrified of PCOS For the past 7 months, the fear of developing PCOS has taken over me, despite have no symptoms. Iâ€™ve always had normal periods. They always come every 28 days and last for 5. Not only that but Iâ€™ve always been skinny, I havenâ€™t had a bad acne breakout since I was 14, I donâ€™t get any facial hair aside from a little on my upper lip and I donâ€™t think itâ€™s possible for me to have diabetes. 

But I gained 3 pounds this month. And my period started yesterday and then completely stopped. So now Iâ€™m convinced I have it and I canâ€™t think about anything else. 

The last time PCOS fears struck me I had two panic attacks in a row and was a state of high stress for a while. My period ended up coming a week and a half early which just made the anxiety worse. Eventually everything went back to normal but for some reason Iâ€™m convinced that wonâ€™t happen this time.

Iâ€™ve always been able to keep it under control but after having a near death experience in my teens, my anxious nature has been directed towards my health. For the past 9 months Iâ€™ve been experience various symptoms, consisting of brain fog, muscle twitches all over my body. sharp nerve pain that seems to come and go affecting everything from my legs, to my wrist and fingers. muscle buzzing (primarily in the feet, feels like a cell phone going off under my foot). This worry of ether a neurological disease or a serious infection such as Lyme seems to dominate most of my days. I constantly make the mistake of self diagnosing using discussion posts of users (on various sites) with similar issues and I realize itâ€™s a recipe for unhappiness. This type of worry feels at times like an addiction that I simply cannot stop coming back to.

I live an incredibly charmed life with an amazing family and incredible fiancÃ©. And I realize Iâ€™m not hard done by in the traditional sense. 

But this anxiety surrounding my health is something Iâ€™m desperate to manage but more importantly be done with.

"Think Before You Post: why reassurance seeking might be feeding your health anxiety. Hey /r/healthanxiety, 

Just thought I'd make a post detailing my personal experience and knowledge about reassurance seeking and why it is self destructive. 

So, you're experiencing your symptom that you're increasingly more worried about. Whether that be chest pains, heart palpitations, stomach problems, poop problems, any of the hundreds of symptoms any of us could possibly be worried about. 

You're worried about if this is the time where your worrying is justified, or if it is actually a sign of the illness you're fearing.

Maybe you've already been to the doctor to get checked out, but doubt their opinion.

All of these have happened to me, and happen to many many other HA sufferers, which is completely okay. 

**However**, the way you deal with it is paramount to your recovery.

Usually, what I would do, is post here, explaining my symptoms and what I was worried it was. Then I'd get some replies reassuring me and maybe feel better for a bit. Or I'd ask a close friend or family member and get the same results.

All of this felt like what I had to do, a huge compulsion to do this just to know that I was fine. 

In the short term, yes, it made me feel better but this was only short lived.

This might also account for medical tests, I've spoken to many people who have previously thought that getting that MRI or CT, colonoscopy or endoscopy, or whatever it might be, would make all their worries go away. Which, after the short term relief, the anxiety came back. This is so important to understand and grasp to begin recovering from health anxiety; I speak from experience.

One of the biggest things in recovery is how you deal with these thoughts and need for reassurance. Possibly even the key to fixing your health anxiety.

So, if you don't seek that reassurance, what's going to happen? For me, at first, it was unbareable anxiety, and just an extreme desire to check I was okay, whether that was through posting to the subreddit, the discord, asking family, checking my body for lumps, checking my lymph nodes etc. 

You'll most likely experience increased anxiety whilst not seeking the reassurance you want, which is completely okay. Rather than seeking reassurance, do something mindful, something genuinely healthy for the mind. As, when in a very high anxiety situation, sometimes it's the things that you do during that time that really define how your mental wellbeing will go in the future. 

You can do many things, for me, it was taking myself away from what I was doing and spending 10 minutes trying to immerse or distract myself within something else, not an easy task by any means, but something to try. After the 10 minutes was up I would come back to what I was doing and try to revert my thoughts away from my worry, which most times the anxiety had passed and I didn't need to seek further reassurance. 

You could possibly try meditation, though, if you don't regularly practice it, it'll be very difficult to do under high anxiety levels. 

You could try relaxing music, your favourite food, anything else that enhances your mood, whatever works for you. 

During this time, you will experience anxiety, potentially more during that time of not seeking the reassurance, but I promise you, in the long run it is going to do wonderful things compared to getting the reassurance and feeding the problem.

When you seek reassurance, you're reinforcing the behaviours which keep your health anxiety alive unfortunately, because usually it feels like the right thing, and the only thing to do in that situation. But trust me, try not seeking it.

It'll be very similar to [this graph](https://thegirlwiththecurlyhair.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/anxiety-repeated-exposure-graph.png), the more you do it the easier it'll be. And it might get to the point where the anxiety almost completely goes after a while of practicing this. 

Seriously, it is worth definitely giving a go and thinking about this if you're currently having a lot of anxiety, I've been there hundreds of times, and applying this mentality was one of the key turning points into recovering from health anxiety.

"Health anxiety is a vicious circle. Not sure if anyone has this, but my health anxiety can fixate around my vision. Thus becoming a vicious circle of worrying about my vision, which makes it worse, which in turn I then worry about...so on and so forth.

"180 on Health Concerns For a few months I had headaches several times a day and thought nothing of it. I mentioned it in passing to my husband who insisted I go to a doctor. Long story short, I was diagnosed with a pituitary tumor. Very easy treatment and no major concerns with it. 

The twist is the medicine I take for it has a side effect of increasing anxiety. For me this has manifested into Health Anxieties and 99.9% of the time at night when Iâ€™m trying to sleep. Iâ€™ll feel a pain in my leg or think I have an elevated heart rate or, or, or, etc. 

I hate that Iâ€™ve gone 180 from being so passive to now fearful or obsessive. Has anyone else had a diagnosis trigger their anxiety? ",1
"Loss of appetite for over a month I believe I got the flu right on Christmas Day, most likely caused by eating extremely spicy popcorn which I have been eating somewhat frequently prior. Went to the ER about 4 days after and got nothing but laughs from the doctor saying there's nothing wrong. Been eating nothing but rice porridge and shredded pork for over a week. I could hold food down but have completely lost the urge to eat since, would occasionally eat out to try and care for my hunger pangs that I think I was having. At first it was difficult to eat or even will myself to eat, got better, then got worse again. At this point, I could hardly eat and have to seriously think about whether or not I am hungry since it's seemingly impossible to tell when it was as easy as a stomach growl before then. 5-6 days ago, I think I got food poisoning, now I absolutely can't eat anything. Got the flu shot maybe 2 days prior and things only seemed to get worse then. Would often puke but wouldn't see food come back out, mostly what looked like saliva (had nothing but rice porridge after all). Went to the doctor's office and was prescribed Ranitidine, the medication may have cause this sense of looming nervousness but it's most likely just me since I've been fine with it every other time after about the second day of taking it or so. Decided that it was now necessary to force feed myself to jumpstart my appetite along with light walking (1-2 miles after each meal or so, I wasn't physically active at all prior, worse since I was bedridden during the flu). I fear that I'm overeating when I've been told to eat 5-6 small meals each day, I've also grown terribly impatient with my recovery seeing as how this has been going on for over a month. I would often feel incredibly miserable and every day I was plagued with anxiety until I decided to force feed myself, I don't care about getting fat anymore, I just want my appetite back, but now I'm starting to fear that I'm going about this the wrong way. The feelings of hopelessness and anxiety have hardly gotten better and while I don't suspect my loss of appetite is due to my anxiety, I can never be too sure. The whole reason why I even had anxiety in the first place was because of how sudden my loss of appetite was, and how I was unable to self diagnose myself since I felt no abdominal pain whatsoever, I'm at a loss as to what's going on with my body.

"Terrified of heart disease Ever since I learned that heart attacks are preceded by jaw and arm pain, I've been walking around in a state of constant paranoia. Because I have asthma, chest pain / tightness is something I like with daily, so throw these things together and you have a recipe for an anxious mess. 

Eating is a nightmare. Every time I eat something even mildly unhealthy (handful of salted peanuts, for example) I can *feel* the sodium and cholesterol in my chest, coursing through my veins around my heart. I know that I'm just being anxious, but damn if it doesn't wig me the hell out.

I got an EKG last summer and multiple CT scans (*including one in December), none of which have indicated heart problems. My blood pressure's a little high, but other than that, I'm technically fine. 

I know that everyone else on this sub deals with this, but damn does it suck.",1
"Psychiatrist wants me to get a blood test She says it could show the levels of medication in my blood and if it's effective, etc. And if I have a thyroid disorder or diabetes or vitamin deficiency or some other physical reason for my depression and anxiety. Yeah, it makes perfect sense to get the blood test.

But I swear to God I just don't think I can do it. I am so sure something serious will be wrong with me and I just don't think I can handle it. Last time I had a blood test I fainted when I heard the results, which weren't actually bad in any way. Just thinking about it has had me depressed and anxious and crying for days now. I'm not afraid of needles, but I can't imagine going to the doctor for the blood test, let alone waiting for days for the results. I just don't think I can do it. I don't *want* to do it, even though I know it's objectively a good idea.

I'm seriously considering just... not seeing this psychiatrist anymore. I guess I could eventually find one who doesn't demand blood tests.

I don't know what I'm asking for here. Advice if you have it, but if not, can anyone relate?",1
"Woken by leg cramp - DVT? I'm a really anxious person and once something goes wrong I instantly think of all the worst things it could be and start to freak out.

Not too long ago, I was suddenly awoken by a severe cramp in my right calf. I've got it stuck in my head that it could be DVT. My legs arent swollen, red, or discolored. The pain was pretty intense but only lasted a few moments or so (less than a minute)

Does the pain usually last longer and not go away? It's still sore and hard to walk on, but not nearly as bad as when I woke.

I have very annoying intrusive/obsessive thoughts I didnâ€™t know where to turn so here I am. For starters Iâ€™m not diagnosed with any anxiety disorder or other mental health illness. Itâ€™s not always as bad as it has been for the past few days but itâ€™s already annoying me so much. Itâ€™s like I canâ€™t relax my mind and the biggest issue for me is watching my current TV show. I know it sounds dumb but itâ€™s what i love doing the most and what makes it easier to get through the day. Itâ€™s like these annoying thoughts keep getting in the way and I canâ€™t enjoy watching my stuff. For instance Iâ€™m up next to solve an exercise in math class on tuesday in front of the class and itâ€™s not for a grade or anything but my brain keeps telling me that I wonâ€™t be able to relax until i complete that and I wish my turn was on friday so i could enjoy the weekend. I donâ€™t know how to clear my mind so i can get into whatâ€™s happening in my TV show and truly enjoy it like I normally do. I would appreciate any suggestions if you understand/can relate to what Iâ€™m going through atm.,1
"So my fears have been confirmed. Wednesday I went camping and ended up sleeping in 30 degree weather, was ill prepared to say the least. Ended up getting 2 hours of sleep while shivering the entire time. So Thursday night I suddenly came down with the chills and a brutal headache. Yesterday I went to urgent care and there they confirmed I have the flu type A virus and a 102 feverâ€”as a hypochondriac this immediately kicked in my catastrophic thinking and always fearing the worst. They gave me Tamiflu which cost a pretty penny. Today I feel like dogshitâ€”aches, pains, coughing but my fever has seemed to drop. But Iâ€™ve been sleeping like shit no more than 5 a night (donâ€™t ya need to sleep to get rid of this?)

Iâ€™m an extremely healthy person so being out of commission like this is literal hell lol.

"What's causing my confusion/delerium 22/M

I've been feeling very confused/delirious since Sunday night. Let me give a little backstory about the events that lead up to this

I've been in terrible pain from a root canal for about a week before this happened, every day I took about 4000mg of extra strength Tylenol and 2000-2400 mg of Advil liquigels until Sunday night, I don't smoke weed often. Maybe once a week or so since last September but I did on Sunday night. Not anything more than I usually do or even a different strain but the night I smoked is the night I stopped taking my pain meds, but it's Friday night now and I feel confused and just overall ""off"" like I'm watching myself through a glass pane. Does anyone have any advice that could help me. This feeling is causing me to have daily panic attacks",1
"Someone please help First of all I urge anyone who reads this to please give an opinion on what they think it may be, I'm worried sick. Thanks in advance.


Ok i've made posts about things I've felt before but somehow everything I had 2 weeks ago is now gone and has been replaced by new fears.

I'll get straight to it, here are symptoms with context:

- Odd feeling on left side of body, mainly legs, only when laying or sitting. Feels like weakness but I can still walk just fine and feel no difference in balance. Sort of like fatigue without any actual excercise to cause it, really odd and it scares me.

- Tinnitus, already diagnosed 2 years ago with bilateral tinnitus and it's got easier to deal with. But in times like these it makes me feel awful. I'm aware of the recent progresses in Tinnitus treatment so it doesn't worry me too much as it's benign and only sounds when i'm in silence.

- Constipation, probably caused by the stress or anxiety. Either way it might be causing me problems.

- Intermittent sharp stomach pains on the left side of my abdomen under ribs, I called the doctor about it and he said it was nothing lethal or worrying but to get it checked out anyway. That my current worst fear, that I had a digestive infection caused by the constipation. 

- A feeling that for some reason, I'm going to die tomorrow from some lethal random attack of sorts, like my intestines will rupture from a tiny stomach pain, or that I'll have a heart attack because I can sometimes hear pounding in my head. That's the worst of all of this, the never being able to relax, I feel on edge 24/7. Researching everything that I can in order to reassure myself, only to find an even worse disease that vaguely correlates to my symptoms.

I always feel the urge to check my speech to see if it's slurred, or check my heartrate to check for palpitations, or check my typing to check for stroke/ALS. I seriously can't keep living like this, why do I keep getting these physical symptoms?!

Many thanks, Max

"HIV worry Hi there,

About a month ago I had unprotected sex with my ex girlfriend (we have still maintained a close friendship). She told me she had been tested for STDs since the last time she had sex, I had had blood work and urine work done since the last time I had had sex also. About a week later she told me she had missed her period and we were worried about pregnancy. She was sick for a few days, nauseous and fatigued. After a while she got better but during that time I asked if she had blood work done, to which she replied no, just urine. She thought the same negative thoughts as me (she also has health anxiety). 

When she got better she assured me that she had just been stressed, not eating right and I had nothing to worry about. She even called me to reassure me.

Now I am studying abroad in the Middle East, and I started feeling sick last week. I had a stomach ache (normal for new bacteria in food) and then a sore throat and congestion. Instantly I thought this was the worst and that I had HIV. Again I told her I was freaking out but she reassured me that I was fine and so was she. I found out that my friend in the program has had the same symptoms  as me and we guessed it was allergies.

Now Iâ€™ve been taking antihistamines and feel better but the thought wonâ€™t leave my mind. I understand that itâ€™s very hard to get anything through vaginal intercourse, plus I am circumcised (0.08% that she has it, 0.04% chance that I could get it from her if she was +). Itâ€™s hard to get tested in the country Iâ€™m in because thatâ€™s simply how it is. Iâ€™ve asked her to get tested but she said sheâ€™s been very busy and she told me I need to get help for my anxiety. I made an appointment with a psychiatrist because I have a history of panicking and anxiety. 

Should I be worried about this?
Thanks and sorry for long read.",1

"Up and down So, my health anxiety focuses on getting pregnant: Iâ€™m terrified of it, donâ€™t ever want to be (Iâ€™m 20) and no doctor will tie my tubes. I thought either my contraceptive implant was broken, i would do pregnancy tests and not trust the result or go digging through the bin for them, I didnâ€™t trust a blood test, I thought every twinge in my body was a symptom. I thought I saw signs everywhere telling me I was pregnant.

Then, last week, after 3 CBT sessions, upping my anti depressants and travelling home to see my parents for the first time in 4 weeks, I had the first â€˜goodâ€™ week since September. No tests, no doctor visits, plenty of exercise, could snap myself out of any dangerous thought patterns. No googling! I was so happy and proud. I even had sex for the first time in 4 months with my boyfriend. 

Then, on Saturday morning, my boyfriend accidentally grabbed my arm implant. Since then, I feel like Iâ€™ve spiralled back of control after just one week of happiness. Iâ€™ve resisted doing a test so far, but I swear my implant is broken even after seeing a nurse, Iâ€™m symptom spotting, googling, crying etc. My techniques to cope arenâ€™t working. I go from feeling scared and upset to angry with myself and the world.

I was just wondering, how do people cope with these type of set backs? How do you pull yourself up again? At the minute I just feel sad and depressed and angry. Fuck you, health anxiety.",1
"Fear itâ€™s not bronchitis. 28 white male

6â€™1â€ 275lbs

Pack a day smoker for ~10 years

No chronic health conditions or regular meds

Current meds: 20mg prednisone 3x a day for 5 days, albuterol inhaler as needed (up until last night Iâ€™d been using it every 4 hours regardless)

On Wednesday (5 days ago) I went to urgent care because Iâ€™d been feeling some chest discomfort. My son has recently gotten over walking pneumonia so I wanted to get it checked out and start treatment early if thatâ€™s what I had. They did a chest x-ray, took blood, did a peak flow test where I scored a 300. Doc gave me a breathing treatment and bumped the peak flow score to 450. Doc said, â€œIâ€™m gonna call it bronchitisâ€ and prescribed me the meds listed above.

In the beginning, I didnâ€™t feel sick; I wasnâ€™t rundown or tired, no fever, no loss of appetite or anything. Ever since I went to the doctor Iâ€™ve felt weird. I wake up feeling shaky, I get dizzy throughout the day, for the first few days my lower legs were killing me, I get these random waves of feeling hot/flushed, and I wake up several times throughout the night either cold or burning up (still no fever, no chills). I feel like the prednisone should be giving me some improvement but the cough is becoming more frequent and more productive (white sputum). Last night it took me forever to fall asleep because the center of my chest hurt. 

Iâ€™ve slowed down on my smoking since going to the doctor but havenâ€™t totally stopped. Iâ€™m just so afraid that this is something more serious. Would something like cancer have shown up on my chest X-ray or blood work? Iâ€™ve been up for the past 2 hours with my mind racing.

He said heâ€™s seen many patients with that illness and Iâ€™m not like them. Sometimes I have paranoid thoughts when Iâ€™m in my mind but I know theyâ€™re irrational.",1

"I'm afraid I have breast cancer in my 20s But I don't know if it's just paranoia, anxiety or my period. My period's never caused this before. A few days before my period started one of my nips was hurting really bad and it kinda kept me awake for a bit, then my breast in general was hurting. It went away after a day, but now a week later it's happening again. Could it be breast cancer even though I'm 22? How do they even test for breast cancer? I don't know if I'd even qualify for getting a mammogram. I'm not sure if I still even have insurance. Also relevant, I've always had a lump in one of my breasts, ever since I was like 18. But it never worried me because I was so young and google said it was probably nothing. And it's been four years since I discovered it and it never killed me. What if though??? I'm definitely not pregnant so it isn't that.",1
"How do you stop fuzzing? My friend is as healthy as can be, but eversince I started really knowing him there's been something wrong. He'd go to the doctor, clear up whatever condition he thought he had and then he'll go home and start googling every single aspect of his bodily functions. (For example: ""Smelling burning wood"" - then he thinks obviously something is wrong with his nose now??) Until eventually he discovers some other condition he may have. Then he stresses it until a doctor clears it up again and then repeat. He would sit for hours up at night reading symptoms, and unfortunately  that is not exaggeration.

He's never fine, never normal, never healthy in his mind. And as much as it annoys me, its worrisome. Because there's no helping a person that always thinks that he knows better.

I'm looking for someone who can advise him on how you coped or even escaped this state of mind. But any advice would be appreciated.

Thanks.",1

"Heart anxiety pvc, vt and cpvt Hi there. I want to begin to tell you that I have suffer from health anxiety for few years. I was actually good for 3 years until 10 weeks ago. 

Last two years I've had skipped beats. Doctor told me it was probably pvc and did no test. I believed him and continued with my life. These skipped beats would happened when in rest so I wasn't worried. Last year I had a hernia surgery and I couldn't run for 4 month's. Then last summer I noticed when I started running that my heart would skip beats or flutter more frequently during excersice. Sometimes just 1-2 times but sometimes 10 times. 

I saw a cardiologist and he did ECG, echo, stress test. My heart is structurally normal and everything looks fine except 1 pvc during stress test. 

I didn't have any anxiety and continue working out. Than 10 weeks ago I was running. I'm not in good shape because I'm scared of exercising. Everything went fine until I had pvc. I continued running and got few in a row! my heart started pumping and I felt numbness and my heart was getting pvc A LOT. I thought I was going to faint but I didn't. My friend called the ambulance. I freaked out When they came my pvc had stop and I just had 150 bpm. ECG showed nothing. Had a blood test as we'll and 2 more ECG which showed nothing. Docs told me nothing to worry about. 

I was fine until week ago when I was watching tv and relaxing. I noticed chest tingling. I took my pulse and it was fast. I had a panic attack and skipped beats, few in a row. I called a ambulance and they did ECG 2x and there we're no sign of anything. My skipped beats were not happening when they came. 

I had a holter and I'm waiting for the results but it only captured skip bear  while at rest. I'm trying to get on with my life but I can't take this anymore. I'm so anxious. Deep down in my heart I worry so much that I have Venticular tachardia because of those skipped beats while excsersising or panic attacks. They came more than 3 in a row and that is suppose to be a bad sign. I want to believe my doctors but I can't get it out of my head that they have never capatured my heart fast and inregular at the same time. Only pvc or fast sinus rate. 

I'm can't sleep I can't enjoy anything and I'm have been a mess last week's because of this Venticular tachardia anxiety. 

summary. I've experience at least two times fast rate and skipped beats. It also happened one time when I had adrenaline rush because of a bad family fight. My heart started skipping beats alot and sometimes even during dramatic sport events my heart races with skipped beats. It happens if I have adrenaline, if I'm excsersising and panic attacks and stress.Also sometimes when drinking alcohol 

I'm 24 year old 90 kg 185 cm never smoked have panic attacks and health anxiety. 

Should I worry that they have never capture my heart going fast and skipping beats? Any advice? be honest.
I had few good weeks with my anxiety but then googled some shit and found CPVT and it's giving me one helluva anxiety.

Im just playing everything in my head. I get more skipped beats when my heart is racing curing excersice or panic.
I have had ECG when it happened but my pvc had stopped already and it only showed sinus tachardia.

I just want to stop think about this. Deep down I know I'm 99% all right but my brain keeps getting what if especially with cpvt fear.

"Should I see a neurologist? I am 19,F and have GAD btw 

1) Went to a specialist, diagnosed me with occipital neuralgia. i ate the medicine and i no longer get these constant headaches. He did a physical check on me to check my vision, balance and muscle strength and it was fine. He told me to just fix my posture. 

2) However, my muscle twitching and numbness (ive always had this my entire life) and my short term memory loss problems got worse. Besides, i now have speech and focusing problems.

"Pretty bad anxiety towards taking meds with a possibility to prolong QT. Help. [Warning: this post got much, MUCH longe r than I anticipated. Sorry to however actually reads this entire essay.]

So, I have a psychiatrist who recently prescribed me sertraline (for chronic depression/ptsd) and trazodone (for sleep) but I actually haven't taken either. This specific phobia started like 1-1 1/2 yrs ago I think. I had walking pneumonia a few weeks ago and absolutely had to take antibiotics and Holy shit, my anxiety was thru the roof every time I was time to take it.  I was absolutely convinced my QT interval was significantly prolonged and I was going to die in my sleep! I feel like I narrowly escaped death after I finished the course. Which is ridiculous.

I have had ekgs countless times, probably like over 10 times (ftr I'm only 18 and only started getting them in the last two years) and for the most part, were completely 100% normal (shocker).... excluding this one time during my purging like 3x a day and keeping literally nothing down phase where my hearts repolarization phase fucked beyond belief.

Actually I'm just going to talk about that a little because the anxiety still plagues me. my heart was physically rattling / shaking in my chest with every beat, like it was unsure of how to beat normally. it was incredibly scary, I think I experienced what I believe was possibly a very brief arrhythmia. at first I thought it may have been a minor seizure (which wouldn't be that unrealistic, as purging (electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia.), sleep deprivation (I had stayed up all night), physical activity while literally running on empty (we were inside playing basketball when it all started) and of course hypoglycemia (essentially not-eating will do that to ya) all lower the seizure threshold, and also how i might have had a seizure once back when I was abusing dxm constantly which of course predisposes you to future seizures) because of how disoriented I got and how everything became slow motion, almost similar to the time distortion one would get on a psychedelic.

......but that didn't explain how my heart rate was reaching 140 (for the record, throughout the last 2ish years that I have been measuring it, it has always, always sat at a comfy 55-60 while not using HR-raising drugs such as dxm or speed) when I got it taken in the nurses office in the psychiatric facility, and how I felt like I was about to die. When I went and got that ekg I believe actually traumatized me in a way. 

Coming fairly close to death (which has actually happened to me a numerous times,  with my purging phase, over exercising phase (I actually kept a fucking exercise bike in my tiny ass room and legit would use it non stop for 3-5 hours to burn off literally everything I ate and then some, feeling proud when my net calories for the day ended up in the negative. it was bad, real bad) restriction phase (I have eaten less than 500 calories / day for months at a time, several times, in fact I can feel a restriction phase coming on, as I am pushing myself to not eat, God I hate being eating disordered, but st this point it's a safety blanket after I've been dealing with this shit day n day out since 13 yrs old me first decided to eat like 100 calories a day for 2 or 3 months (can't rmmbr) cos I was obese. Cant really remember if I started out with disordered thinking and intentions, or if it just was a crash diet-turned weird obsession and addiction to weight loss. and also, this one non eating disorder related time I was riding in a car with my mom maybe 1 1/2 years ago , legit almost got tboned (we would have been hit on my/her side of the car, had we been just 2 seconds slower getting through the intersection, that person would have hit us. oddly enough, she was panicking, yet I f elt absolutely nothing, no adrenaline, no fear, nothing. I attribute that to how I learned to dissociate from everything at. A young age due to my father's husband abusing us constantly (lol dissociation as a coping mechanism is cool (not))

I wholeheartedly believe I could have died if I continued with the purging (I still get extreme anxiety when I analyze that specific ekg I know I should throw it out but I just can't, I am a person who is very much into record keeping). I feel like I am not actually alive, that I died months / years ago, and this is maybe purgatory. I alternate between genuinely feeling like I should truly not be / am not actually alive, because of all of this shit. Not sure if that's connected to the ptsd or what. I mean, I was dxd with major depressive disorder with psychotic features, at one point. God my life is a nightmare. I so desperately wish to take the place of a normal person Ie didn't have an abusive biological father, isn't a piece of shit drug addict, doesn't harm themselves via eating habits and excessive exercise, doesn't have all these stupid ridiculous mental things. (how did my life end up like this.......) I fantasize about it alot. Normal people with normal lives take that shit for granted. It angers me. They just don't understand how goddamn lucky they fucking are, Holy fucking shit. 

(Oops, sorry for the going off on a total tangent. That happens to me sometimes.)

Anyway...How do I get over this.... I honestly would not take any med like that on a daily basis unless I had an at home ekg that I could use like 12 times a day. Actually, every time I discontinued an Ssri or antipsychotic it as because I could ""sense"" that my QT interval was prolonged. Even if the drug was helping me. It's horrible. I have a cardiologist appointment soon because I got minor chest pains during exercise a few weeks ago. Which doesn't sound particularly bad, but that, coupled with the knowledge of the fact that many people can have silent heart attacks and asymptomatic arrhythmias, it's downright terrifying. I am scared about what I might find out, if I mayhaps did permanent, structural, unfixable damage to my heart muscle from a only a several month long bulimic episode, and am now much, much more vulnerable to cardiac events.... I almost don't want to go. 

Now what's weird about this phobia, is that I currently am using Xanax at night and meth during the day and I'm also a smoker. Its weird how those three things are pretty not-good for you, yet I have less anxiety about smoking a cig or a bowl of meth than taking an anti depressant???!???

It's so irrational and honestly I believe it's an ocd thing as I also tend to take my blood pressure 4-20 times a day (no fucking joke) and weigh my self constantly and also check my pulse to see if my heart rhythm is ""normal"" about 10x a day. My blood pressure is so good that even as I am fucking high out of my mind on meth and just smoked a cig, the highest it goes is like 130/85 (which, insanely and funnily enough, is still probably lower than like 70% of Americas blood pressure, lmao), which is just slightly hypertensive. It's normally, with only the Cigs and no meth, like 90/60, sometimes even like 85/57, no lie. I attribute it to my whole food/plant based diet. I'm not really sure why I still compulsively take my BP. But anyway This anxiety is destroying me. I really do think I need to be on an SSRI or something, but I guarantee I could not even take a single benadryl without panicking hardcore.

So. Does anyone deal with this fear of an abnormal heart rhythm specifically? I just wonder how common it is. And how people deal with it. (/end Xanax fueled rant about my mental issues. I would be shocked if anyone actually reads this entire essay)",1
"Swallowing air, mostly when laying on my back Since the start of this year Iâ€˜ve had really weird symptoms. It started when i suddenly noticed some faint clicking noises at the back of my throat. I got very scared because i was high (on weed) at that time and since weed does trigger paranoia I was sent into a full-blown panic attack. While being in a panic attack I first started swallowing a lot of air due to an anxiety reflex. After sobering up, I was back to normal. But stupid me thought it was okay to smoke weed again so I had my next panic attack, shaking and just feeling and hearing all the air move in my stomach and abdomen. At this point i quit smoking. Yet after that incident i noticed, that whenever I laid down on my back and swallowed(mostly the normal spit-swallow reflex) i could hear and feel tiny air bubbles travel down my esophagus. this happens absolutely subconsciously, I cannot control it. Iâ€™ve also noticed how sometimes my ears and my throat hurts. Now Iâ€˜ve become extremely aware of how i breathe, how I swallow and  when I feel or hear something weird in my body and this led to searching the internet for various reasons as to why this may be happening to me. Iâ€˜ve thought about hiatus hernia(the conditions where the diaphragm pushes into the stomach or the esophagus), GERD(but Iâ€˜ve never noticed any acidic reflux), and so on... Itâ€˜s gotten so bad that some nights I canâ€˜t even sleep because Iâ€˜m having such bad anxiety about my symptoms... Iâ€˜ve gone to three different doctors, the first one completely ignored my symptoms and just said the bloating comes from an intestinal infection(or something like that idk), the second one sent me to a therapist to whom Iâ€˜ll go to in march and the third one didnâ€˜t find anything wtong with me, just like the first one. Itâ€˜s extremely hard for me to live with this condition, because wherever I searched, Iâ€˜ve found absolutely nothing that actually led me to an illness or such. Iâ€˜m using simeticon to relieve the bloating, because Iâ€˜m not able to burp all of the air out. But I may add that I do burp a lot because of the subconcious air swallowing which sometimes happens eventhough Iâ€˜m not laying down. When I lay down on my back though, it happens almost constant. I was wondering if anyone here has or had something similar to this? :(",1

"Terrified of a brain CT scan I had Sorry guys, long post but I just need to get this off my chest and I feel like I'm going crazy...
Firstly, I'm a 23 y.o. male in relatively good health training and playing sports 4ish times a week.

So recently I was having a weird pain on the right side of my brain and ongoing pressure that didn't go away for about 4 days. Eventually I went to the doctor who said we should do a 'scan' for reassurance to check if it was serious.

I stupidly just went along with radiology and did a brain CT scan when I could have asked for an MRI. Now days later I'm absolutely terrified of the affects of that CT radiation on my brain/body and so much regret I didn't speak up and demand an MRI instead. I've been emailing the clinic and they said that on average a brain CT with the machine (Siemens 64 slice Perspective) they use gives 1 mSv for a brain CT (I'm worried that this is just for a brain scan and that the person doing it would have hit my head among other body parts so the dosage might have been higher). 

I've now been reading about ionizing radiation for the past few days non-stop with occasional glimpses of hope about how overall the radiation impacted me is nominal compared to the background we receive. But then there are so many questions that stress me out, is receiving a large dose in one go the same as a 2/3 a year of exposure to the body? How much radiation can our bodies deal with? Is there now mutated DNA in my body that could cause problems in the future? Am I more sensitive to radiation than a normal person?

I can't sleep properly and I spend my days distracted reading about the odds of contracting a fatal cancer because of a stupid CT scan I could have said no to. I just want some proof to say ""look, the radiation you received is minor and there is almost no risk with the CT"". I've read every resource there is (I think) and done every calculator I could and it still stresses me out. **This fear of cancer is partially because I lost my mother when I was quite young to lung cancer and I'm just terrified hereditary impact this has on me**

tl;dr: Had a brain CT worried about brain tumours/cancer and now worried the scan could have done more harm then good.",1
"What is wrong with me? Iâ€™ve always been extremely articulate and smart. I operated on a higher consciousness than most people just in the sense that I was more aware of my surroundings and I thought deeply about things. I was also quick witted and being funny was probably my defining personality trait. Until about a week ago, I felt like my normal self (still a very anxious person regarding my health, particularly a brain tumor). Now I just feel like thereâ€™s been a substantial cognitive decline. I canâ€™t think as deeply and Iâ€™m constantly second guessing myself on if Iâ€™m using words correctly. I feel Ike my vocabulary is getting worse and I google synonyms for words about 30 times a day. At the same time, I also feel more relaxed. It sounds weird but Iâ€™d rather feel smart and anxious than dumb and relaxed. Iâ€™m not even particularly happy. I feel like I have no emotions (something that has been persisting for a while) but now I feel like I have no intelligence (something new to me). I am slower to respond in arguments and donâ€™t feel as witty as I was two weeks ago. Maybe Iâ€™m thinking too much about my speech but I just wish I could revert back to normal. Everything just feels so superficial to me. Itâ€™s weird. I know a symptom of brain tumors is a shift in consciousness. Iâ€™m messing up when I talk a lot more. I feel like Iâ€™m forgetting words and not winning in arguments (very rare for me). Iâ€™m only 15 (almost 16) and feel like I have Alzheimerâ€™s or something. On a side site, the only other truly concerning symptom I have that could be indicative of something more serious is the smell of smoke occasionally. This isnâ€™t a daily occurrence or even a weekly but maybe once or twice a month, Iâ€™ll get a whiff of the faint smell of smoke that is certainly not coming from real life. As of lately, I just feel so dumb. I just canâ€™t stress the fact that Iâ€™ve never felt this way before. I hate this feeling. I havenâ€™t really had emotions for a while (this is due to some trauma Iâ€™ve been through) but lack of intelligence is brand new. I may not be completely devoid of my intellect (as Iâ€™m able to express my thoughts coherently in this format) but I feel slower than usual. I use to partake in writing creative stories and stuff and I tried to do that yesterday and I struggled and was uncharacteristically out of ideas. Sorry if this sounds repetitive but this has been going on for about a week now and Iâ€™m not sure whatâ€™s up. My parents wonâ€™t let me get an CAT Scan (I got an MRI in March 2016 and everything was fine). Is there a possibly a tumor couldâ€™ve developed in this short of amount of time? Thoughts and opinions please. I just feel like a completely different person



Also sometimes when Iâ€™d feel really weird or things would get too heavy, Iâ€™d cry and the feelings would subside. Now I canâ€™t even cry cause I feel like I donâ€™t even have feelings in the first place. I use to be able to explain this perfectly all the time (or so it felt like) and I took great pride in my ability to articulate things. Now I feel like whenever I do so, thereâ€™s a little voice in my head questioning what I say and if it makes complete sense. I now I sound articulate in my post but I donâ€™t feel like I sound like this in real life. Or it at least takes too long for me to express myself. ",1
"Tested a VR headset (for phone, Bobo Z4) &amp; before I could adjust settings to get rid of incorrect settings (the screen was double), I felt my left eye sting and after that, weird sensations in my eye areas and in my head/brain... kinda electrical and spasm-like, worried Health anxiety sucks - it sucks more when its symptoms overlap with the symptoms of physical conditions.

But the symptoms described in the title above were a little... odd. Epilepsy-concerns emerge, perhaps mild, but still leaving me concerned. Could it just be something that had to do with my eyes needing to adjust, or the settings not being correct and thus messing me up for a bit, or should I be worried about epilepsy/photosensitivity? I figured I'd ask around to see if it is a sound concern... no access to a doctor right now unfortunately, gotta wait til tomorrow.

"Fear of exercise and moving/exerting myself Hi. I have had many issues with fatigue in the past, and they were really terrifying. I've come to develop some kind of PTSD with exercise and exertions..

"Spinning Downhill All Over Again, PLEASE HELP! I haven't been to this sub in over a year. I started stressing about the things I was reading, and freaking out more, even though I just wanted to support others like they were giving me. I decided to stop googling, stop this sub and try to re focus, to feel some relief from the anxiety.

 2018 has started out pretty rough, issues with relationship, stress and more stress have been a real struggle. Therapy hasn't been feeling the same neither does school which last year I was so happy to actually be doing. It's a sad time.

Between all this I've tried different things to help me, yoga, some gym, journaling, hobbies etc. I realize that my life will forever be good and bad days....TODAY IS A BAD DAY! I'm overwhelmed and I'm not even out of bed yet.

I feel asleep fine last night (thankfully) and sleep through most of the night (again, thankfully) however I woke up at 530 to my right thigh twitching so quickly and non stop. Maybe I needed a stretch? No...Still going. 

It doesn't hurt but I've regrettable done something bad. I've let myself have bad thoughts, then fueled them with the dreaded Google...PLEASE HELP.

1. I saw where it could be just benign twitching...COULD BE. Last year I went to the gym and may have lifted  wrong so the next day I had arm twitching almost all day. But for this case I haven't been to the gym since Monday! (Now Wednesday). Can't be that...right?

2. Stress can cause an overload of muscle stuff...even if I sleep? I'm dissecting everything right now. Yes it's been a hard month with you health fears and questions and stress but I'm now like thinking to myself I'm not really that stressed can that truly be the cause?

3. Google sucks, it's the worst type of fear enabler, yet so accessible. I'm finding so much, Lou Gherigs disease??? Ahh!!! I can see the twitch so that's promising but I'm finding it hard to no look up other symptoms...is it possible???

4. Heart issues! I've always been focused on cancer and stuff along those lines but now I'm freak g about heart stuff. My fit bit typically sometimes shows a range of 58-119+bpm depending on exercise, and relaxation etc. 
I didn't sleep with it last night, but as soon as I saw the heart stuff on Google that heart arythmia and skipping beats I ran to put it on. It ran 54 bpm... then at 66  down to 61 bpm (granted back In bed in my safe zone) but what if my heart is beating too low??? It's slowly shutting off and gave me the leg twitch as a signal?!?!   

I'm terrified again, upset I'm stressing out about this and worried I might not get out of bed today.

Please help, I could use any words or advice. So scared...",1
Scared to death of some wierd symptoms. Greetings. I have extreme health anxeity. For some time i have had troubles with floaters that looked like spiderweb. Recently these past weeks i have also noticed stars in my eyes. They seem to appear randomly and they also move with my eyes similar to floaters. They appear for some seconds then they disapear. I wen't to the eye doctor and he told me that i had PVD or occular migraine. He also told me that my right pupil was smaller then the left one so he called some neurologist and he did some tests but there was nothing wrong with them. But right now im starting to belive that he was wrong and that i have some super rare eye disease or maybe a brain tumor.

I did find out how I fell asleep after finding my controller beside me where i was watching YouTube before I fell asleep. ",1

"Blood Tests Hey yâ€™all,
First time poster, so be kind :) 

I have had health anxiety for a long time. Iâ€™m currently a 24 year old female with lots of manageable chronic issues. This requires a lot of blood tests.

Every time I have to get one, I get really freaked out to the point of causing fights with loved ones and raising my blood pressure with constant anxiety attacks. Iâ€™m afraid I may pass or during blood tests, and passing out is one of my biggest fears. Hearing about how itâ€™s really not harmful and Iâ€™ll be fine once I wake up is unhelpful. Itâ€™s a trigger for me.

And hereâ€™s the thing: I have never passed out, only gotten slightly woozy. Every time itâ€™s better than I imagine it being. 

Can someone give me some advice on how to prevent the slow spiral? ",1
Should I be worried about hickeys? Hi Iâ€™m already anxious about some things but now Iâ€™m really anxious because I got a few hickeys last night and one of them is really long and runs for about 2-3 inches down my neck. I read an article about two people who died from a blood clot that came from a hickey and Iâ€™m worried that because this one is so long that will happen to me too. They seem so innocent like just bruises but Iâ€™m freaking out. Does anyone know anything or should I be worried ,1
"Aneurysm Fear? I was minding my own buisness last night and heading to bed when a sudden pain took over the left side of my forehead. Lasted all of about 10 seconds and was abrupt, but it did make me go ""Ow!"" internally. The throbbing continued for around 20 or so seconds afterward. The event, however, left me feeling mentally discombobulated. I felt so spacy and out of it when moments earlier I had clarity. Derealization galore, feeling like I wasn't myself or in my own body. I was also very sleepy, so I fell asleep moments later. Today, I have pain, but only behind my left eye. 

Sure enough, Doc Google says that this is an aneurysm and impending death is imminent. I can't tell if I have a dilated eye just by looking at it, but one pupil is larger than the other (although this isn't much of the case when I take a pic with flash on it). The pain behind my left eye is more of a nusance than anything extreme.

I'd think that one'd know when something this serious was about to erupt, no? That's the scary thing about things like this. Anyway, health anxiety in general has been ruining my life lately.",1
"Swam at public pool with contacts I was fine swimming around but when I went home, it occurred to me that swimming with contacts in for 2.5 hours in a crowded public pool is maybe a bad idea. Internet confirms this...

"The news is giving me anxiety, can anyone relate? (popular journalist dies of a heart attack after some random stomach pain) TRIGGER WARNING. Stop reading if you get easily triggered.
So this poor journalist lady who's very popular in my country died of a heart attack few days ago and the news went crazy. Of course it triggered me anxiety, as always when I hear of someone else dying. She was 50 and from what I heard she was a healthy and active woman ( this makes me even more anxious knowing that no matter how healthy you try to be you still can get a heart attack) . Apparently, she was having a heavy stomach ache and went to doc. She stayed hospitalised and suffered a heart attack during endoscopy procedure. They say that maybe there was smth wrong with the anaesthesia,  Weird bc it's one of the best private clinics there. So is stomach ache a symptom of heart attack or she died because of anesthesia negligence?. It's worth mentioning that her father's a doctor and she knew a lot about medicine and she didn't seem concerned during her stay",1
"Is it just me, or does merely learning about the body trigger some anxiety? I've  just started taking a general biology class at uni. My professor is a microbiologist, so he knows a lot about infectious diseases and virus. He's somewhat informal, so he often goes on tangents about various diseases he's familiar with. It always scares the crap out of me! 


Even learning about the physiology of the human body triggers my anxiety. My thoughts do, ""that sounds extremely important, and also delicate. If something goes wrong with this process, I'm screwed."" Does anyone else experience this?",1
"Terrified about continuing to go to a chiropractor I've had neck pain and stiffness for months and after an MRI and EMG found nothing like herniated discs or tumors, I tried PT and only got worse with periodic lightheadness and nausea.

I'm so desperate for relief that I started going to a chiropractor, which I've always been skeptical of as a profession. The chiropractor said x-rays show my spine is very rigid and doesn't bend like it should when I look straight up, so he thinks my cervical joints are the problem.  

My neck feels worse two days later after he used a ""chiropractic activator"" on my cervical spine (no twisting or cracking, it's a kinetic energy thing that looks like a glue gun). I'm terrified of getting a dissection of the arteries in my neck and having a stroke. But the medical literature shows that cervical dissections are rare, and my family and friends who have had benefits from chiros are encouraging me to see through a few more sessions.",1

"People who had the flu this season and are better now Ok so Iâ€™m usually pretty level headed about the flu. I have had it in the past and I usually donâ€™t freak out. And I didnâ€™t this season either until my best friend brought up how surprised he was that I wasnâ€™t freaking out about the flu which lead me to googling everything and seeing news articles I wish I could unsee.

"I (28F) Health anxiety - Help. How did you get over it? Health anxiety SUCKS. Like, really sucks. I literally have no reason in my current life to be so down sometimes but I am and I hate it. I'm literally crying. My grandmother, two of her sons, and one of my female cousins have diabetes. My mom does not and neither does my 14 year old sister. I'm 28, eat relatively healthy but was pretty sedentary up until 3 weeks ago. 

I weigh 151.7 and I've started exercising 6 days per week (1 hour Zumba) super high intensity with plyometrics incorporated and have felt pretty great. I have remained at around the same weight despite all of this. I went out last Thursday (about a week ago) and got drunk which I never really do. I rarely drink but I felt so terrible and I'm not doing that again. I was super dehydrated and felt like crap all weekend but I still went to Zumba that Saturday. Out of nowhere, I start thinking about diabetes and now I'm freaked the heck out.

 I went through all of my medical records from the past couple of years to try to calm me down, fasting glucose at 96, at 78, at 87, most recent in December 2017 was 96. On 5/5/2016 my a1c with eAG estimation was 5.0 and my a1c today was 4.9. I did eat a small tub of mangoes from HEB and a green juice prior to my glucose test and that came back at 148. This was literally 10-15 mins after eating. I've had some random shooting pain all over my body for a while now, and for the past couple of days (Sunday) I have cold feet I cannot warm up at all. 

Granted, my whole legs hurt and they feel cold from my butt down. My muscles are pretty sore as I've been doing squats and jumping all over the place for an hour daily. I took a rest day today. I seem to find charts and charts about ""normal"" diabetic ranges but not normal non diabetic ranges for immediately post meal and that 148 is freaking me out despite of the a1c level.

Should I be worried? Also, I started new birth control (Vienva - generic for Aviane) and I think this may be causing the cold feet? and maybe the anxiety to go to extremes? I asked the Dr. on Nurx about the birth control and she said it's not a normal side effect of the medication although it is my experience that sometimes they aren't aware of all. 

My health anxiety started about two years ago with a diagnosis of H. Pylori (which has been resolved naturally) as the Flagyl and antibiotics caused the first ever anxiety bout I've ever had and continues today.  I also had my gallbladder removed and then went to a gastro who said I didn't even need it taken out despite pain attacks. 

I've had EKG's, Echo, CT of the pelvis and abdomen with contrast ad I was also getting palpitations. Determined those are PVC's but I did not want to take beta blockers if nothing is structurally wrong with my heart. 

I just want to be the old me. Three year ago me who gave no fucks about anything until that shit. 

TL;DR: Is it diabetes or just health anxiety? Help! I want to be the old me :(",1
"Skin condition Hi guys

Lately i have been having a severe skin issue whereby the skin above my ankle sort of dried off and created this ulcer looking condition.

"Frequent cold sores (ulcers) on lips and intense fear of Bellâ€™s Palsy returning Hi all, frequently ill and frequently anxious person here. Iâ€™m going to be seeing my doctor (again) to ask about this issue but lately (past few months) after a really bad flu that resulted in a mouth full of ulcers and palsy afterward (which I luckily recovered from), Iâ€™ve been terrified of this happening again. I feel I have been getting more frequent tiny ulcers on my mouth almost every month or so. It scares me every time I feel a warm bump. I have no idea why they are so much more common now and itâ€™s disheartening (and discouraging - theyâ€™re ugly!). And, it scares me that the palsy could return or flare up again as Iâ€™ve read that itâ€™s very possible :(

"Another Small Tip If you start to panic. And you need to tell someone. Try, instead of telling them your symptoms, just standing next to them and don't say anything about your symptoms.

Is that gas pain or is this the heart attack?  I should check my pulse to make sure (20 times a day)


I used to never get headaches, must be cancer!


My mouth is sore... gotta be cancer.


I slept too much and am still tired.  Definitely on my death bed.


My eyes are red today.  Not dry eyes, definitely cancer.


Lemme check my strength to make sure I am not getting ALS


Feel kinda weak today.  Definitely cancer and not exhaustion from 9 hours of work.



Thatâ€™s the second time Iâ€™ve had diarrhea this week- probably cancer and not my IBS.


Feeling a bit chilled; Iâ€™ll be dead by tomorrow.  Likely cancer.


Havenâ€™t I already had a cold this year?  Two in one year must be cancer.


Shit lemme check my pulse again...


Sore shoulders?  Cancer from that sunburn I got 15 years ago probably.


Slight cough?  Definitely cancer from second hand smoke.


These may sound silly but are things that have gone through my head, obsessively, for years.  I get blood work done every year and it always comes back outstanding.  Sometimes it helps to see how silly it looks. 


EDIT: Forgot to add my personal favorite- â€œis that spot on my body sore? Lemme poke it and prod it 100 times over the course of the day.  Shit, itâ€™s sore now.  Gotta be cancerâ€",1
"Rabies Anxiety - Long Term Incubation I'm not sure how many of you are familiar with rabies as the subject of your health anxiety, but one of the worrisome things about it is that there have been documented cases where the incubation period after exposure to the virus has been years and years, as high as 25 years in one case (although the evidence for it is not definite). A few other examples of long incubation periods include 4 - 6 years, and around 15.  

My fear here is that despite not having rabies yet, I am incubating this terrifying virus and will ultimately die from encephalitis and insanity, which is the outcome of all rabies diagnoses. 

11 years and 8 months ago I handled two baby raccoons over a period of days my aunt found in her yard after her dog killed the mother. We kept them for probably 3 days, and I would imagine my aunt had them for 2 or 3 days as well, before we gave them to a local animal hospital which gave them to a local wildlife rehabilitation center before release. After dropping them off with the clinic we never heard anything else from them. My father confirmed with me yesterday that he left his contact information. I called them yesterday and they don't have documentation about it that far back, but the woman on the phone was not exactly reassuring because apparently a local, unlicensed person was doing the rehabilitation back then. Still, it's someone who would have had the animals in their care for a period of time that would have seen anything to indicate rabies.

I don't recall the animals behaving strangely, but that doesn't say much. I also don't recall being scratched to show blood (maybe some white-marking from their little claws, but no deep contact) and if they did get saliva on me, I don't imagine it was on an open wound. My aunt, father, two neighborhood friends have not gotten rabies. We never heard anything back from the animal hospital. The only report of raccoon rabies is from 2003, before this happened in 2006. In that county in 2006 there was only one documented case of raccoon rabies in the wild (not humans). For the length of time we had the animals, we would have seen some sort of odd behavior. 

And it's been almost 12 years. What are the chances I'm a case study for long term rabies incubation?

I'm trying to avoid reading because its causing be to become extremely paranoid. I feel like I'm becoming less intelligent or becoming brain dead or something.

"freaking out about dvt!!! Hi all. i literally just found this reddit 20 minutes and, im already. extremely thankful for it, I've suffered with bouts of health anxiety on and off for years and its been one of the most soul crushing things to experience in my life. Lately since I got a big job my anxiety has latched back to my health again because it constantly needs to focus on something with me. I'm a massive worrier in general, its terrible but Im trying my best all the time. a few months ago it hyper fixated on blood clots on my legs and DVT thus causing like intense leg pains and what not i think after months of just fixating on it (and also developing a real actual flu that was debilitating and not from my hell brain I just wore it out of my brain which is cool i guess. except not really because I've recently developed a lump in my neck (most likely frm flu). its painless goes from feeling tender to firm but it swims around a little on my neck and goes from unnoticeable to like really noticeable. what has me freaking out though is that its on top of an artery, we went to the er after i had one really bad freak out and managed to at least get a nurse to check it (we would have stuck around for the doctor but it was like 1am and we would have had to wait til like 5 am. also my mom kind of started giving me flack on all of this bc she's extremely impatient on my hypochondria and really horrible about it) who took my blood pressure and kinda felt it , she assumes its a lymph node and i know a nurse isnt a doctor but im trying my best to be rational in that ok maybe she is right because nurses do experience a lot of shit with patients and should be pretty well versed on things. but idk its been  like 2 weeks and its still there and my brain is just. in literal hell . im just freaking out that every day is my last and i just have  clot hanging out there even though its like painless and not red or like super hot to touch and in like like the next 20 minutes i mgonna just endure a stroke or something and my brain is fried enough as is so im not even processing thoughts properly or anything. also w hypochondria since im like still googling shit on what it may be!!! im starting to endure what im assuming is sensations im  making up like pains in my neck whatever. but im also like paranoid that im actually right on all of this because this is the most real physical thing ive experienced i guess with my hypochondria. also ive seen some stuff with swollen things in necks with cancer and at this point im just trying to not even look into that because i think i'll literally have another break down, im sorry i guess, i just needed to vent somewhere where others would get what im experiencing because at home its been very much condescending and dismissive and i feel extremely trapped and upset. I'd love to go back to the doctors again myself but I have really bad agoraphobia as well and due to how condescending my folks have been with me i feel extremely embarrassed/ashamed/upset on any of my emotions on all of this and how much im fixating. its just really scary and im just really sad at this point. anyway thank you for reading this if you do and being patient with me if you respond",1

Return of anxiety after periods of well being/healthy lifestyle. I'm starting to see a pattern in which different HA develops for me and how it always seems to happen after a short period of little to no anxiety(typically after resolution of previous anxiety) OR after you start making healthy choices. When I start running or working out I feel at my best but that also comes with me being hyper-aware of my surroundings. I'm beginning to think that it is this self consciousness and overly attachment that I have developed and reinforced over the years which has led to this becoming a persistent problem. I have a consistent HA of rabies and hence I'm super aware of all the potential causes that could transmit the virus to me. As you all know by now that this attitude is more destructive than defensive. It has gone to the point that I've started reading scientific literature in hopes of finding the best treatment for my anxiety rather than the health issues. Has anybody noticed similar spikes in their anxiety? ,1
"Aches and Pains after a flu Hey all. So I was suffering from a gastro flu for the last 5 weeks. Reduced appetite, nausea, chills, aches and pains, diarrhea etc. all the good stuff. Felt like it took forever to get over. I even had a bad relapse last weekend.... Anyway, i seem to be coming out the other end and am starting to feel better. However, I am still getting aches and pains in my muscles. Seems to be pretty inconsistent, sometimes it's my back muscles (around my shoulder blades), sometimes it's my shoulders, arms, and forearms.

"Obsesssion with Hepatitis C from manicures I'm a woman in her late 20s.  Now that I am talking with my husband about having a baby, I'm starting to worry that I could have hep c, and could pass it to my baby.  You might think ""Easy, just get tested"" but that would stress me out more than anything.  There are so many false positives, not to mention the fact that if the healthcare law changes, I could have a ""preexisting condition"" on my record.

My therapist doesn't think I should worry.  I am not a baby boomer, IV drug user, never had any blood transfusions, my only unprotected sex partner is my husband, etc...none of the major risk factors.  But I can't stop thinking about the few manicures I've gotten in my life.  I've only ever gotten about ten manicures at a salon, but I've read that this is a possible mode of transmission.  Of course the logic side of my brain tells me that most women get FAR more than 10 manis in their life, and most women do not have hep c...but I can't stop thinking about it, especially because I've bled on a few occasions during manis (I've had probably about 20 pedicures in my life, but they were at a high end salon that showed off how well they sterilized everything)

Also, I got a tooth pulled in 1997...I assume that's late enough in history for them to be sanitizing everything, but who knows?

About 4 years ago, I had a CMP blood test done and my liver enzymes showed up normal.  I assume that if I had had hep C for *that* long, something would have been amiss.  But I still can't stop worrying.

my therapist thinks I'm clinging to this because I'm secretly more worried about being a mother, or the changes a baby will bring, but I've hyperfocused on this to distract me from the ""real"" concerns....

Anyway, is he right?  am I unnecessarily obsessing over this?  How often do you hear about young women with no risk factors coming down with hep C?",1

I'm pretty new to posting but I've struggled with health anxiety for about 18 months now. Thought I got on top of it, but I think I was spending my time worrying about other stuff...anyway.
My first obsession was a brain tumour but now it's liver cancer, because on saturday I went out and got drunk and now I'm obsessed I've lost all alcohol tolerance which could be a symptom.

"My health anxiety caused me to get a CT scan and now my anxiety is in overdrive over radiation risks I am a hypochondriac but this time I have been having some severe abdominal pain for 2 weeks. It's constant, not one second of peace, sleeping is very difficult. I've visited doctors, blood tests are normal. I even managed to do an endoscopy, which has always been one of my worst nightmares. It showed just a mild gastritis, nothing to explain my severe constant pain. I've been taking treatment but there is absolutely no difference. Doctor ordered a CT scan and I was hesitant but after some sleepless nights I decided to go for it. Well the result came right now and there isn't much wrong, just a fatty liver and some benign stuff with my prostate. Now I am sad I've irradiated myself for nothing (although, I don't really regret it, never had such pain in my life). The risk is like a 0,2% increase in cancer but some believe the risk might be a little overestimated for CT scans. I will never accept another CT scan in my life, unless it's an emergency. All doctors said abdominal CT scans are better than MRIs so that's why I didn't get an MRI.

How do I get past this? I still have the pain and no diagnosis and I increased my risk of cancer. One way of dealing with the risk is to think of it like a screening, at least I know there isn't anything sinister going around in my belly.",1

"I'm 16 and going through hell. My anxiety exists due to my high heart rate and I have some questions. I've been dealing with this crap for almost 3 years. It all started with a bad infection that almost costed me a finger. Since then I've thought I had cancer, autoimmune diseases, genetic disorders, neurological disorders, diabetes, severe mental issues beyond anxiety, and a whole bunch of crap. Luckily, I saw how ridiculous this was before it got too severe (hehe it probably is but not as much as it could possibly get). 

Now my problem is my heart. I know it is supposed to speed up when having stress, anxiety or panic, I know why my fingers tingle, I know why I hyperventilate and how it makes things worse, I know why I get headaches, I know! My issue is that it speeds up in a way that I think is too fast. For example, during anxious moments my heart rate is around 100-120: normal and I understand. During panic attacks my heart rate is about 180-205: not normal. 
My question is if anyone relates to this? 

The funny (not really funny) thing about anxiety is that the symptoms cycle. Anxiety is a smart cookie who knows how to fool you pretty bad. I've been writing down EVERYTHING since this started and I've learned a lot about how it works. I've solved my past ""diseases"" by finding the flaw in my thinking process but this time I can't. I can count my heart rate when it is  that fast. I believe heart anxiety is one of the most difficult ones to beat because the heart does some weird things that we're not supposed to feel but anxiety allows you to. I get ectopic beats ( My heart stops for a few seconds and then beats strongly again) which I know are normal but I feel them and people are not supposed to feel them. It's all due to my anxiety. 

Anyway, I'll repeat my question again: Does anyone else gets heart rate of 180 to 205 BPM during panic attacks? ",1

So for the past year i started with going for runs around my block and lifting small weights. Then when I got better I jogged for longer periods of time and got a bench press and heavier weights. So I have been lifting weights 6x a week and doing some cardio here and there. I hope i'm not overtraining. but now that my resting heart rate has dramatically decreased (went from 70-80bpm to now about 40-50bpm while resting) 

Scary shit. i don't want it to lower anymore... I'm scared it will just stop while i'm asleep cause it will go too slow and i will die. Irrational? Probably. Impossible? No. That's why all of us worry about this! All the diseases we can get, and death... don't get me started on that. Doesn't help I'm an athiest and have severe DPDR.


God, The story of a boy who lived a sedentary lifestyle up until he was in Grade 9 and then overexercised and killed himself in the process. WTF. I don't want that to be my life story FFS. Just scared. The hospital nearest to me has a bad reputation and houses many drug addicts and is overall filled with sketchy patients so i wouldn't exactly feel safe there. But I'm hanging in there. It's late where i am, school tomorrow. Took 0.5mg Lorazepam about an hour ago. I hope i'll live to see tomorrow ;(",1

"Do I have an aneurysm? Why do I keep thingking my jugular vein is hemorrhaging? I am a 21 year old male. While I often get random stinging senations all over my body, and have gotten panic attacks for several diffirent reasons, my first panic attack, and main source of worry it would seem is my neck. My first panic attack was in the gym a few years ago when I was pushing myself which raised my heart rate, I felt a throbbing in my right jugular and convinced myself that I had burst it, aninhad somebody call the ambulance while hoping the blood transfusions would arrive in time. I hyperventilated on purpose to make up for the ""blood loss"", which made the experience worse and left me scrutinizing my beating and and feeling a drowning sensation for half a year.

Sometime later I got some sort of cramp near my left jugular, which freaked my out so I went to the doctor, and they said my jugular was fine. Then less then a week ago I sneezed strongly which made my left jugular pulsate strongly, which freaked me out because... Well why only one side? 

Today I was at the supermarket, coughed strongly and felt pain in the left jugular when I did that. Within a few minutes I was about to pass out, my hands were cold, and my whole body was buzzing, which of course ""confirmed"" to me that I was in fact losing blood. I did mange to snap out of it but why won't this just go away?",1
"Iâ€™m worried sick about melanoma Three years ago when I was twelve I had a blue speck on my heel. I remember thinking if I stepped on a marker or not.

"Throat Issues/Fears This is my first time posting on this subreddit... I've had some nasty health anxiety that's been going on since I had brief exposure to asbestos tile about a month ago during some home renovation. Ever since then, I've been convinced that I've acquired cancer of the mouth/throat. I recently went to the dentist to check out some mouth sores and bumps, and they were found to be nothing. 

For the last week and a half, I've had some issues with what feels like swallowing on my right side of my throat. No real pain, but also no lumps or bumps in my throat or neck to speak of. Recently though, I chose to feel in the back of my throats and felt what feels like cartilage/bone on the right side of my throat. It is a hard ridge, and doesn't appear on my left side. I don't have any pain, and haven't had any other symptoms to speak of. I'm wondering If anyone would have any idea what this is, or maybe it's just normal and I'm overly paranoid due to my recent health anxiety. 

My fiancÃ© is a PA student and hasn't been overly concerned at all, and at my physical a month ago a blood test showed normal white blood cell count. I still can't stop thinking it's cancer though, and really looking for advice/help on this. I've been through a lot of stress lately, and just looking for some support. Any thoughts, help or support would be much appreciated. ",1
"Random Small Scratch On My Hand ... Rabies? Hi,

I was out walking today, around 12:00 noon, and when I passed a tree I heard a flapping of wings, but I didn't see if it was a bird.

For some reason, I felt the need to check my hand, due to the slightest feeling I may or may not have made up in my head, and I regret ever deciding to so. I found a small scratch, with two little hole-like cuts about a centimeter apart with little scab linings connecting the holes. I'm deathly afraid that I got bitten by a bat and didn't really feel it. I'll include a picture of the cut as well. Does anyone have any information on bats and bat bites? I know that some are so tiny that they're hard to notice.

"Distrust of doctors and diagnoses - how to overcome? I've had quite severe health anxiety for a few years. It's hopped from one malady to another, and medical counsel/tests do not assuage it as I'm always convinced they've missed something.

Most recently it's cancer - at first lymphoma, now cancer in general. I've visited specialists, GPs, had chest xrays and bloodwork, and finally a full CT scan with contrast. Despite the all clear in each instance, I spend a debilitating amount of energy on the anxiety they've missed something. Each diagnostic procedure seems to buy me a few weeks of calm before the terror and doubt returns.

I do not have systemic symptoms of cancer and am in apparent good health save mild diagnosed GERD -- but compulsive google'ing assures me many healthy people in their early 30s are diagnosed with terminal cancer out of the blue, after numerous misdiagnoses etc. That GERD must be stomach cancer, the lymph node that swelled after a dental infection must be lymphoma, the doctors are brushing me off, the medical system in Korea is inadequate, the medical system in Australia is inadequate (I've carried this pattern through the doctor's offices of three nations!)

I recognize the compulsive and anxious biases I'm operating on here, but I don't know how to change them. For those who have endured something similar - how do you learn to trust the doctors' ""all clear""? How do you trust that you would probably show some obvious symptoms in case of serious illness, and those symptoms would be correctly interpreted?

I'm feeling exhausted and hopeless from the unending cycle of costly medical tests which produce little effect on my anxiety. Your advice is appreciated.",1

"Absolutely terrified of having autism. Does anyone have fears of mental illness/ developmental delay? This would honestly be funny if it didnâ€™t scare me so badly. I donâ€™t really even know why it scares me this much, and I feel bad because autism isnâ€™t strictly a negative. Itâ€™s just a different wiring of the brain that emphasizes different skills. Itâ€™s dumb, but I canâ€™t help it. 

Last night I had a nightmare that I was actually autistic and that no one had ever told me so that I could live a more normal life. The whole thing shattered my perspective of myself in a way that was profoundly uncomfortable and was kind of from a third person view although I felt everything very intensely. I looked quite different, but the thing that freaks me out is that what if I actually do look like that and just have a very limited outside perspective of myself. I also saw a bunch of ways that maybe certain interactions I thought were normal may only have felt alright because Iâ€™m actually autistic. 

This all would just be a weird one off dream if I hadnâ€™t been terrified of being autistic for a long period last summer. I would spend every break possible at my summer internship taking diagnostic tests to prove to myself that I donâ€™t have it. I was an anxious mess.

Since then, Iâ€™ve had a number of fears about having different mental illnesses (everything from schizophrenia to NPD to bipolar) and donâ€™t know quite what to do about it. I think I have ocd, but I havenâ€™t been able to go to therapy. 

Has anyone else had hypochondria about these specific themes? What strategies help you?

"Overcoming exhaustion? First time poster here. I think itâ€™s appropriate because I think a big part of this may be health anxiety related.

I keep getting super sick. Last year I was not well - bronchitis, pneumonia - from early October through thanksgiving, then caught the flu in early December. Yesterday I started coming down with aches and sore throat, had to take a day off work to rest and am fully exhausted still.

I donâ€™t know if this is a real thing or if this is normal given the circumstances?

"Ear infection or something more? Hi all, this is sort of a follow up post from this: https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/7xnd17/when_to_go_to_the_doctor_for_recurring_flu/

I woke up with ear pain this morning in addition to the other symptoms and Iâ€™ve had recurring ear infections for the past few years so I didnâ€™t think it was related to everything else going on. The doctor said that itâ€™s a middle ear infection and my lungs sounded clear, my throat looked fine, etc. so the fever and aches are all from the ear. While I was in the waiting room I went and replied to my post above. A few minutes after the receptionist called me up to the desk to get my doctors note for Work and when I got there I faintedâ€”like full on blacked out, unconscious, woke up confused and surrounded by nurses, etc. Iâ€™ve fainted before but only when needles were involved. The doctor said I had low blood pressure and low blood sugar (probably true, Iâ€™ve had no appetite and have barely eaten) and the fainting was not because of the ear infection itself. Iâ€™m home now and my fever is still 100. Iâ€™m just worried because the ear pain didnâ€™t even start until today but Iâ€™ve had the fever since yesterday. Do you guys think I need a second opinion or am I overanalyzing this?",1
"Does anyone else have a rotating 'portfolio' of health worries? I've had a number of scares in the past year since I've identified my health anxiety. I wouldn't call any of them explicitly painful, but there's a distracting discomfort that's hard to shake and when a panic attack happens, the discomfort is magnified a hundredfold. 

My mind tends to focus on one of them at a time : my chest, my abdominal area, my tooth filling, and my testicle. Doctors have already told me that each of these areas are fine, and I'm mostly mentally stable with that, but when my anxiety flares up it tells me that the doctors didn't do enough tests, they just brushed it off as imagined anxiety pains or IBS because I'm young and the probability of something serious is low. It's like my anxiety constantly picks at my defenses to see if it can get a footing and crawl into my brain. 

I used to be a WebMD nut that would look up every odd symptom and have panic attacks. I still get freaked out by the odd thing; that I have a brain tumor every time I misspell a word or I flub some speech, for example. But I'm mostly sticking to the ones I know nowadays.

"Cross post with AskDocs -- random swelling?? Hello,

I'm a 23-year-old female, non-smoker, otherwise healthy despite an insane amount of anxiety. I've had slightly swollen lymph nodes on my neck for a while, but doctors I've seen haven't been concerned because I weigh 116 pounds and have a really thin neck -- an ENT basically told me to dismiss it unless they actually get bigger. It's only one one side. During my appointment with the ENT though, I insisted she check my parotid glands because the left side of my face feels a bit swollen. She agreed, but said it could be caused by a ton of things. My cheek is a bit swollen on the inside, too. It's most notable right under my ear lobe, resting on my jaw. It feels like a lump that's noticeably bigger than the right side of my face.

She referred me for an MRI with contrast, and suggested I cancel a sonogram I had scheduled because an MRI would be better, anyway (I did.) I haven't had that yet, but I'm really freaked out and wondering if there's anything else I should be concerned with or if I should take her advice to just chill. I've had ulcers on that side of the mouth before (12 at a time, two years ago, apparently caused by stress), I wore clear retainers for two years that could have caused swelling and I had impacted wisdom teeth removed 8 months ago. They were more impacted on that side of my mouth. I'm not sure what to do, just wondering if I'm going crazy or if I'm right to be concerned. Also, I'm more short of breath lately (not like, short of breath in a way where I'm sweaty and my heart's beating fast. Short of breath like my throat feels tight.)

"Is this â€œAnxietyâ€? Iâ€™ve never considered myself an anxious person.
Starting probably last week, Iâ€™ve had a strange urge/feeling to breath deep, as if to catch my breath. Itâ€™s like the feeling of turning the water on cold in the shower. Once I take that deep breath, it goes away for a bit, then usually comes back until I do it again. Yawning makes it go away as well. 

Itâ€™s weird, it feels like I am now consciously thinking about breathing (which I have never really done before). Sometimes feels like my throat is tight, and sometimes this whole thing even makes me lightheaded.

Iâ€™ve been the the doc, had an EKG, Chest X-ray, all checks out ok. Curious if I am experiencing anxiety? Is this a symptom? Any help would be appreciated!! ",1

"Health anxiety makes everyday tasks so difficult Some background about my health anxiety history - Iâ€™ve had severe health anxiety intermittently since my teens.  Most often I am preoccupied with my heart.  My heart rate has always jumped up quickly (~180ish bpm) with minimal exercise or even at times of rest, but my resting heart rate is usually 45-55 bpm.  I mention numbers just because my heart rate is a little atypical-but I have been checked out by cardiologists so many times over the past 15 years, always with the reassurance that I am fine. Most recently, this past summer I wore a 30 day holter monitor where they would measure my episodes of high heart rate. They also did a stress test, numerous ekgs, etc. They confirmed I had periods of sinus tachycardia, but it was normal rhythm and said I was healthy.  They said the heart was appropriately responding and was likely beating fast because of anxiety (which I donâ€™t think is the whole story, I think I have a food allergy which can trigger it, but thatâ€™s beside the point.). They gave me a low dose of beta blockers to take as needed for comfort/anxiety, but promised I wouldnâ€™t have a heart attack, with or without the pills.  

Anyways, to bring my story to today, Iâ€™ve been putting off doing laundry for far too long.  Im embarrassed to admit I have been buying new clothes to prolong my laundry chore. The issue is in my apartment I have to carry my laundry down a few flights of stairs, outside and into another building. After itâ€™s clean I have to carry it again outside and then up a few flights of stairs. The laundry basket is heavy and my heart races so fast when I do this, and I panic. 

I just did a load and I could feel my heart beating out of my chest. I sat down with a glass of water and within 60 seconds my heart rate was back in the 70s. I remind myself that my stress test was normal, even when they brought my heart rate to 190 for several minutes. But I am still so freaked out. I have several more loads to do and Iâ€™m so afraid.

I know part of the answer is that I am incredibly out of shape and weak. This is not coincidence -I am extremely avoidant of anything that raises my heart rate , and am terrified of exercising.  I stopped wearing my Fitbit a few months ago (at the urging of my therapist) because I obsessively measured my heart rate and was even afraid of standing up/walking - I believed if my heart rate went above 80 it would trigger a heart attack.  Taking off my Fitbit was one of the scariest things Iâ€™ve done but now that itâ€™s been a few months I feel SO much better.  I do my best not to measure heart rate now and have been going on more walks, but lifting anything makes me feel my heart rate and I canâ€™t ignore it.   I just feel so stuck and like I canâ€™t keep up with basic chores.  I feel like a failure of an adult. 

I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m asking for, this is mostly a rant. Iâ€™ve been lurking this subreddit for months and itâ€™s brought me a lot of comfort.  Health anxiety is such a difficult illness but this community helps me feel less alone.

TLDR: my health anxiety is about my heart rate/heart attacks. Basic chores like laundry elevate my heart rate and cause panic and avoidance. Feel like I canâ€™t keep up with life. ",1
"My silly panic attack last night I'm sharing this panic attack story because I feel it represents health anxiety and might help you all to cope with physical symptoms. This might be a little long.

I had had a stressful day at work and had also done an anxiety no-no and googled my irregular period symptoms I have been having recently.  Needless to say this all made me panicky by the evening. 

When I got home I vented to my husband, smoked some high cbd low thc cannabis and worked out for an hour hoping that would calm me. It worked for the most part until bedtime.

I was laying in bed surfing the interwebs before I fell asleep when it happened. A weird physical sensation. Felt like my throat went numb. Now I had experienced  this symptom before about a year ago and at that moment I had forgotten about that. A year ago I had a full neurological check up including an MRI. Of course all results were negative and I was fine. In the moment though I couldn't remember that. 

So I started to get nervous. Is it a stroke or seizure? Is my throat closing in anaphylactic shock? I had to check to be sure. So I shove my my finger into the back of my throat feeling around. I'm pushing in really far and playing with my uvula. I can feel everything. Good okay. Throat's not numb. But wait, why am I not gagging? Thats weird. My finger's digging in but I'm not gagging at all. I think you all can guess what I did next, right? Yup, I googled it. 

What came up was horrifying. The worst results I have ever seen from Googling symptoms. Then BAM! Heart starts racing, my face goes numb and I start to shake uncontrollably. I start calling my husband's name telling him I think he should call 911. Luckily I recognize the shaking and racing heart as a panic attack and not a part of the symptoms mentioned on Google. 

My husband was a champ! He got me started on deep breathing and began to comfort me. I started to calm the panic attack pretty quickly but what I saw on Google still screamed in my head. I wondered if I could wait to go to urgent care in the morning or if I really should go to the er now. 

I always worry about the boy who cried wolf kinda symptoms. Like I keep getting weird symptoms and it's always nothing but the one time I should have gone to the er I ignored it instead. I'm sure we've all been there. 

I explain to my husband what triggered the panic attack and he insists I'm fine. Its at this point I remember I've had the numb throat feeling before and had negative MRI results. But I had never stuck my finger down my throat. Maybe if they had known I couldn't gag they would have done another test or know other symptoms to diagnose me. 

As my panic attack subsided I got up to use the bathroom. Away from my husband I tried to make myself gag with my finger again. Nothing. Next, however, I jammed my toothbrush down my throat and GAG! Oh sweet relief! I can gag! Turns out, after testing it out, I can't gag myself with my own finger. Or at least it's really hard to. 
I had jumped to conclusions because, well, how often does a person try to gag themself with their finger? 

I think a lot of our symptoms are like this. We become so sensitized and aware of our bodies we notice things we never paid attention to before and then freak out fearing the worst, or Googling it. These are really just normal body sensations that most people are able to ignore or not even feel.

I should have kept the fact I had a rough day in the back of my mind and taken a minute or two after I had noticed the first symptom to see if it went away by distracting myself. And never ever ever Google a symptom! NEVER! I know we know this, and I know how hard it is not to, but don't, and don't body check your symptoms either. Distract or truly objectively analyze your symptoms. More often than not they will go away or not be nearly as strong as they first felt. 

This was my first panic attack in over a year and I'm not letting it get me down. It has reassured me that while uncomfortable, panic attacks aren't dangerous. It also allows me to recognize my symptoms of stress leading up to an attack so next time I can perform more stringent self-care before it snowballs into an attack. These moments are only making it easier for me to recover from anxiety, not making it worse. Stay strong everyone! ",1
"Just have to get this out Female, 33 years old, BMI 23 

April 2017 I got a cough/cold.  I continued coughing on and off for months, mostly in the morning, no other symptoms (ie no weight loss, no fatigue).  In October, after several months personal upheaval I managed to go to the Doctor who sent me for a chest x-ray just to rule out an infection.  Chest x-ray comes back with what the radiologist says could be a chest infection so it's recommended that I take antibiotics.

I take a week of amoxicillin, on the 4th day I start getting a rash on my hands and feet which starts creeping up my limbs on the following days.  I call my Dr who recommends that we switch to a different antibiotic (sorry, don't remember which one it was).  I take that for a week.  After the course is over I'm still coughing, mostly in the morning.

I go back to my Dr who sends me for another chest x-ray which comes back with no indication of infection and then my Dr sends me on to a respiratory medicine specialist.

Respiratory medicine Dr orders blood tests, chest CT scan and a breathing test.  Blood tests have come back with borderline high levels of IgM and I am FREAKING out about what this means.  No results from anything else yet.  

Respiratory medicine Dr thinks I have reflux and has put me on 40mg of an acid reducer.   At no point did she say she thinks I have any signs of anything life threatening.  

I'm just so scared.  I've always been a hypochondriac, and I am finding it really hard waiting for the results from all these tests.

I really need someone to tell me they know what I'm talking about. Okay so at night I have this weird thing happen to me. I can only describe it as RLS - but it's NOT in my legs. It's in my arms and the back of my head?? It's like my arms are tickley. It feels like there's millions of bugs under my skin but they also feel light. Like feathers or jello. So hard to describe. I will wake up with it in the middle of the night/early morning and just lay there thinking im going to die until I have to go to work..nothing i do stops it and it's been months. I'll have it for a couple weeks then it will go away but a few weeks later its back. I've been thinking I have MS or a brain tumor forever now (and more symptoms keep popping up) but nobody listens...I've been to the doctor 27 times (for many of things) in the past 6 months and I keep getting the ""you're perfectly healthy"" although I've never got a CT scan or MRI. they've done neurological ""tests"" (eyes and strength/balance things) and then said theres no need to do scans and put radiation in my body for no reason. I've tried looking this up many of times with no answers. I'm scared of a wrong diagnosis. If they are right then HOW can anxiety cause this? How. it doesn't make sense. I'm  terrified and exhausted. Normally I'd be more frantic but I've been laying here for hours already and I'm just getting tired and pissed at this point. How come all my anxiety stems from being scared to die, but I don't want to exist anymore?..",1
"A method I use to reduce my health anxiety Hiv

Gonorrhea

Chlymedia

Mouth cancer

Bacterial infection

Stomach cancer

Throat cancer

Herpes

Going blind

Going deaf

Intestinal parasites

IBS

Heart defect

Lung cancer

In no particular order all of these have been individual cases of my health anxiety since April last year where I have genuinely believed without a shadow of a doubt I have got and began to process the self diagnosis as the truth and you know what...
NOT A SINGLE FUCKING ONE OF THEM HAS BEEN CORRECT!!!!!!!

Now I look at this list everytime I begin to self diagnose again. Not googling symptoms has also had a massive improvement.
I've also noticed that it is when I have a lot of downtime that I get my health anxiety back and it is virtually non existent when I'm super busy as my brain has something to focus on.

Hope this helps someone! :)",1
"Placebo effect I take vitafusion womens multivitamins and I notice increased energy. However it has things like 300% DV of B-12 which sounds like overkill. I eat very healthy and try to eat a balanced diet, but I notice that when I stop taking the vitamins for more than two days I start to feel tired. Maybe its other factors that are causing that tired feeling. I know that you pee out excess vitamins, but ive read that vitamins arent really necessary if you eat well. I was thinking of only taking it on days that I felt like I wasnt eating a balanced diet and was lacking in certain areas. Any advice?",0
"Advice? Life's become quite hard worrying about heart attacks I'm 19, 6'1 and about 75kg. I've drank loads of energy drinks in my life and I'm a bit lethargic, I don't do anything deliberately to exercise. But I'm not fat and I don't eat too badly and whatever. No family history of heart attacks at all that I know of, just a lot of cancer. But the past 5 months, literally every day I worry I'm having a heart attack. Whenever I get a bit of chest pain I sieze up and think ""Right, this is it"". And I was never a worrier before this, I'm a really confident person, don't mind getting up on a stage at all. Yet I spend a lot of my days worried shitless about heart attacks now. I went to hospital a few months ago and had a lot of tests done and they said they'd found nothing wrong with me. I had an ECG (I think it's called EKG in America?), blood test, chest x-ray, ultrasound in my belly, obviously the doc checked me out with a stethoscope, and they couldn't find anything wrong. Yet the worry didn't go away. Over Christmas it got really bad, I got scared just walking down the stairs thinking it'd kill me. I do get chest pain and I do think it's real and probably happens worse/more frequently to me than most people, but it's probably just indigestion or something, right? I do eat quite a lot of spicy food and I like fizzy drinks. I don't worry much about other things like cancer, I don't worry about them as much as I should. I just worry about heart attacks and suddenly dying. I always feel uncomfortable in my torso and I'm not sure if there's something wrong the doctors haven't found or if if's purely anxiety. I'm not prone to heart conditions or to anxiety, which came first? Which one is real? I feel a pain in my chest and I get a shooting pain down my left arm fairly often, isn't it natural for me to worry about that? I might have a heart condition that's only detectable when I move around and walk and get the heart going a bit more.

Dunno why I worry about silly shit I can't control. All I know is I have to walk 20 minutes to class this morning and I know the whole time I'm gunna be having mini panic attacks thinking any second I'm going to die. I'm not going to die, right?

Tl;dr I'm not at risk of heart attack but I worry about it a lot because I get a lot of chest pain. Doctors can't find anything wrong with me. I'm not usually an anxious person but I worry about this more than I probably should. How do I cope? What's wrong with me?",1
"My vision is blurry and I think I have MS This is a lot so bear with me. And it's mostly a vent because I'm absolutely fucking terrified.

Last Saturday I woke up with weirdly blurred vision in my right eye. I have pretty bad eyesight to begin with, but this was different. I thought it was because I was hungover or something, but it didn't go away. I made the mistake of googling and holy shit I'm losing my mind. Everything I'm experiencing, the blurry vision, the color distortion, the eye pain, is consistent with optic neuritis- which is usually the first symptom of MS. I'm so fucking terrified and I can't shake the feeling that I just found my death sentence. 

I went to the eye doctor and he said he didn't see any damage in my eye, but he wants me to go back in tomorrow and see if anything has changed. Which it hasn't. I still can't see worth a damn out of that eye. He said I might have to get an MRI which I'm convinced is going to show that my brain is full of lesions and tumors and all sorts of awful things. 

Anyway there's not a lot of point to this but I'm a major hypochondriac and I'm not in any way ready to deal with the fact that there could actually be something wrong with me. I can't focus on anything and I've spent all day crying. I'm usually at least able to say ""well, I'm probably jumping to conclusions and it could be this instead"" but literally everything I read said that I have MS. And even on the MS sub there's tons of posts where people had the same symptom as me as their first sign of the disease. It's a lot to handle and I'm not doing well. 

Thanks for reading if you made it this far.",1
"Weird body sensation I've been going through a bad batch of anxiety the past month or so.

At one point I was so anxious my fight or flight response kicked in for about a week and I've struggled to get rid of all of those symptoms. Which in turn has led me to believe I'm hypomanic which adds to the anxiety.

Anyways, every once in awhile I'll get this very weird bodily sensation that is very hard to describe. It almost feels like my whole body and head feels numb/tingly but also heavy. It always makes me think of clay stress balls - this association always pops into my head which makes me even more anxious that I'm 'losing my mind'. Or like silly putty when you 'snap' it vs stretch it. The longest it's lasted is a few minutes. But now it happens for maybe a minute at most because instantly I start fretting about what it is and seem to scare myself out of it. 

Could this be related to anxiety, or something deeper? Anyone experience anything similar? Or does it sound like dpdr or a hallucination or the beginnings of mania/psychosis?",1
"Left thigh pain/tingle/numbness Since I was 19 (29 now) I have had tingling and numbness in my upper left thigh/leg. When I was 19 I went to the Dr, he picked up my leg patted it and said looks like a healthy 19 year old leg to me. I am starting to get concerned because the pain has been getting more severe and I am worried it is something major. Anyone else experience this?",1
"Worried sick. So. I have had health anxiety very bad since I was a kid. Around 22 years of dealing with this since my dad died out of the blue from a heart attack when I was almost 8. 

It ranges from cancer to HIV to ALS and everything in between it seems like. 

So. On Friday last week. I noticed that I had a lymph node under my jaw on my right side that is swollen. So swollen to the point it's visible to me and other people. 

Last night I went to the ER because I was freaking out so bad. They told me I had strep throat and the flu and that's what was causing it. But, I really have symptoms of neither. Other than a few red streaks on my throat I can see with a flashlight. No sore throat, no fever, no cough. 

Should I just trust the doctor? I really just need some calming down here. I trusted him for like 30 mins and then went back to the whole ""well, what if they got it wrong or got my tests mixed up with someone else's thing that I do a lot. I am at my wits end right now. ",1
"Worried Hey so Iâ€™ve been a hypochondriac for quite some time now. A few days ago I slept with this guy and even though I used a condom and Iâ€™m on birth control Iâ€™m worried I may be pregnant. My period still hasnâ€™t come yet but it can also be irregular sometimes due to my birth control, ( Iâ€™m on Nexplanon). I read online that taking high amounts of Vitamin C and taking Dong Qaui and Black Cohosh supplements can help with miscarriage. I started taking 2 capsules of 568 mg of Dong Qaui and 2 capsules of 540 mg of Black Cohosh every 2 hours and 5,000 mg of Vitamin C since Monday. I was also pressing down hard on my uterus a few days ago and now my uterus is tender to the touch, Iâ€™m experiencing nausea, lightheadedness and racing heart rate. The nausea, lightheadedness and racing heart rate could be due to my anxiety but I donâ€™t know. 

I realize that what I did was stupid and I stopped taking the supplements but now Iâ€™m worried what if I injured myself my pressing down too hard on my stomach? Iâ€™m thinking of maybe going into urgent care tomorrow and Iâ€™m also scared to tell my doctor, I feel like at times she really judges me for having anxiety. I also feel so ashamed and stupid right now and Iâ€™m so scared I hurt myself",1
"Health anxiety for other people After a lifetime of obsessing over my own symptoms (currently â€œhaveâ€ colon cancer and/or ovarian cancer, btw), Iâ€™m now completely convinced my husband has head and neck cancer. He has been clearing his throat more than usual and is in a risk group for that particular cancer. Heâ€™s 37 and otherwise healthy so heâ€™s not dashing off to the doctor, but I now have a strong anxiety response *every time he clears his throat* and Iâ€™m making myself and him a nervous wreck. Like, I KNOW he has it, and am envisioning how the entire narrative will play out. What horrible thoughts! 

This is the first Iâ€™ve dealt with the hell of health anxiety for other people. I didnâ€™t think it was possible to have any LESS control :( ",1
"Premature Heart Beats This is one of the hardest things for me to deal with. I have had premature atrial contractions, premature junctional contraction, and premature ventricular contractions for like 4 years now. At one point I was in bigeminy for 1.5 months. Scariest and most depressing time of my life. I could not leave the house and was in constant discomfort. I went to every doctor and they all claimed they were benign. Cut out this, add this, don't exercise too much, exercise more.

This is what gives me Health anxiety. There's nothing I can do about it. All my doctors including my Mayo cardiologist and electrophysiologist says an ablation would more than likely make things worse. So I live with these day in and day out. I've tried everything. The best thing I have is magnesium glycinate

What do you do when the something you can't fix.? But you still have to go on. I'm not even worried about them killing me but they caused me so much discomfort that it affects my quality of life. I don't see an answer to this.

Health anxiety to something that is actually physically happening to you but is considered benign truly sucks. Sorry for the rant",1
"Blood test anxiety I just had my blood taken for my upcoming physical.  I am worried sick about going in to have the physical and finding out if my blood work found something.

Iâ€™ve had health anxiety for many years and it seems to get worse as time goes on.  If it was maybe one appointment a year I might be able to deal with it but itâ€™s seeing the gp every six months, gynecologist, dentist, mammogram, etc.  Iâ€™m at my wits end with worry and just want to cancel.",1
"New to this Hey all,
Iâ€™m new to Reddit but some recent health concerns have made me feel like I should reach out to some objective people for my situation. Iâ€™m 24 years old and before a little over a week ago, I thought I was in great health. A little over a week ago I started noticing heart palpitations (didnâ€™t know what it was called for a while) and chest pain. I thought this would just go away but it didnâ€™t after a couple of days. Then I had my first and second ever anxiety attacks. These were scary but I felt like I was anxious about my palpitations because they lasted all day and night. My pulse was constantly 20 bpm faster than it used to be, and the chest ache and pain lasted almost 24 hours. Iâ€™ve seen doctors and nurses and Iâ€™ve had a chest X-ray, blood work, and CT done and they didnâ€™t find anything abnormal. Iâ€™ve been tracking my blood pressure as well and itâ€™s constantly in the 150/90 range and today (during a snow day) Ive been laying in bed and the pain and palpitations are feeling worse than ever and my BP was 160/110 and my pulse 105. I had a Holter monitor and Iâ€™m waiting to hear the results. I also started seeing a counselor. I donâ€™t consciously feel anxious, and my symptoms last all day and all night. Iâ€™m waiting for my next doctors appointment but Iâ€™m just reaching out because I feel worse day after day and just wanted to see if anyone else has been through something similar to this.

Thanks",1
"Anyone else scared of the flu and frustrated with the advice to ""protect yourself"" by washing your hands? So scared of flu. I'm so tired of these articles on protecting yourself from the flu. What scared me is that sometimes you have to be aorund other people and you can't help it. I got the flu because I was on the subway and a lady coughed in my face, it was a crowded car. I couldn't get away. Washing my hands won't do shit. I am so scared to leave the house because the flu is deadly. And people will infect me. ",1

"Massive abdominal pains for the last 2 days... Hi guys,

I'm in a pretty bad state right now. For the last 2 days I've been having really big and sometimes debilitating pain in my abdomen area. It first started around the side of my abdomen kind of like a stitch, then throughout the day it slowly travelled to the middle just above my belly button. Last night the pain travelled down to my lower right which instantly got me worked up thinking of appendicitis.

Phoned 111 and they recommended I go to the local A&amp;E. The blood test was fine and the doctor said he doesn't think it's appendicitis. The problem is this pain has been so intense for the last 2 days and it doesn't seem to stop, just travel around my abdomen a bit, but is very intense in the lower right at the moment.

Any idea what this could be?",0
"I've had health anxiety since 2012, i've been learning to manage it pretty well over the last couple years. Today I had a bit of a relapse so I wrote something to get my confidence back. Over the last 5 years I have had:

-Schizophrenia
-Pancreatic cancer
-Multiple Hernias
-Testicular cancer
-Urinary tract infections
-Blood clots / DVT
-Pulmonary embolism
-Heart attacks
-Angina
-Stomach Ulcers
-Misaligned vertebrae and ribs
-Meningitis 
-Bradycardia and Tachycardia 
-Brain Tumors
-TMJ
-Aching shoulders, neck, back
-GERD and food intolerances

Somehow I have survived all of these... 

My symptoms were:

-Headaches
-Insomnia
-Shortness of breath
-Palpitations
-Racing thoughts
-Indigestion 
-Tight aching muscles
-Dizziness 

My treatment for these was:

-Constantly checking pulse and breathing
-Checking for symmetry 
-pushing and prodding where I felt it hurt until it did hurt 
-Twisting and turning until I felt that symptom again
-Avoiding anything that I believed would make my symptoms worse (flying, eating certain foods, exercising too much or too little)
-and most importantly googling for the exact scenario I believed to be true e.g. 'headache above left ear associated with brain cancer' or 'sore achilles hill sign of DVT'

I have (literally) spent $1000's on:

-GP's (who always tell me the same thing)
-Physios
-Chiros
-Missed work
-Miracle cures (e.g. magnesium, vitamin B, etc...)
-Dietitians
-Ambulances

All to conquer my 'Sicknesses' 

The reality is though...

I was sick in 2012, I was truly diagnosed with Graves disease,

and although very treatable (and it has been treated).

it scared me to my core.

I became overaware of every sensation in my body and thought in my mind.

I believed that I needed to be aware to ensure I would survive.

This habit manifested itself into my true and worst alement health anxiety.

Health anxiety has stole time and experiences from me for 5 years.

It made me doubt myself.

It made me loathe myself.

It crippled me. 

However, I have been getting my life back over the last 2 years.

But it has taken effort, commitment and the realisation that this is here with me still (at least for the time being) and without consistent maintenance i'll end up back where I was.

Some days it still wins, but with each month those days get less and less.

My health anxiety no longer and will never again define who I am.

"Scared I have mouth cancer, at 19. Background, so I've been out at college since August, been to a couple of parties, and took up smoking, why, because it looks cool. There I admit it. I would say I've been smoking since around Octber or November. I smoke maybe half a pack every other weekend, if that. Maybe have one or two on the side, here and there, but I wouldn't consider myself a smoker. I've noticed a sore in my mouth, it's all white, doesn't look harmful. I think it's a canker sore, as I've been drinking coffee like hell these past couple of weeks, sometimes without regard for how hot it is. Is it possible to get mouth cancer after smoking maybe two or three packs of smokes in total in my life, or am I just freaking out over a little blister? Thanks for the help. ",1
"Fear of Brain Damage My health anxiety has completely debilitated me for the past four months due to worry that I damaged my brain from drinking for years.  I constantly test my memory and feel it is declining rapidly.  I have trouble picturing things from seconds ago in my mind, all my memories no matter how distant or recent feel insanely foggy, time is flying by as I feel Iâ€™m not forming new memories, and I often canâ€™t remember if I did something today or the day before even if it was just a few hours ago.  Scarier symptoms involve me feeling confused and unfamiliar with my own family, house, dog, etc. and feeling like I have to remind myself where I am or where Iâ€™m going.  I have brief moments of confusion where I have to piece everything together and constant memories that have nothing to do with what Iâ€™m doing (which lead me to a fear of seizures that I ended up being tested for) that have happened for he past few years when I was super anxious.  

I have had an MRI, CT, PET, 3 day eeg, and neuropsych testing and everything came back good but I canâ€™t believe my symptoms are just anxiety and derealization since it feels itâ€™s progressively getting worse over the past few months (which I barely have any memories of).  I honestly feel I have severe short term memory loss and have posited thy maybe I was having seizures and brain damage from alcohol but the neurologist, psychiatrist, GP, neuropsych and therapists all donâ€™t think so.

I have in the past believed I had HIV, liver failure, mouth cancer, throat cancer, and other ailments and of course they all ended up being false but this one feels so much more real.  Has anyone else ever had extreme memory issues just because of anxiety?",1

I am not exhausted and am able to leave the house easily, and can stay active. What do you suspect this is? I'm scared I'll go into Septic Shock and die.",1
"Rabies anxiety So, I have pretty severe rabies anxiety, which usually only acts up in the summer. I'm lucky in that I don't really worry about cats or dogs, since I next to never interact with them, but I'm absolutely *terrified* of a rabid bat getting into my room and biting me without my knowing it. We've had bats in our house twice now, and maybe two or three years ago, finally did an exclusion in our attic and had a professional go around and seal everything up.

I haven't slept with my window open at night for several years now, but last night, I left it open by mistake until around 4 in the morning; which, naturally, set off my anxiety. I have a screen on my window, which sort of sets against a little interior strip of wood, but it isn't tightly sealed, and there's one side that's actually quite loose (big enough that a bat *probably* could get through).

I'm trying to be very logical about this, but I'm struggling. I was in my room basically all night until I went to bed (at around 4 AM), and never saw a bat, or heard anything against the screen, but just *knowing* that my window was open, and what if a bat got in while I wasn't looking or when I left the room or something? Reasonably, I know a sick bat wouldn't be able to get back out if one had gotten in, and I don't think there's any way I *wouldn't* notice a bat flying around -- healthy or otherwise! -- but it's very hard to convince myself of that.",1
"Freaking out about chipping a tooth I was eating a hamburger today and I felt a crack in the back of my mouth.

I can't feel anything obvious, but I am noticing an asymmetry in the shape of one of my rearmost teeth when feeling it with my tongue.",1
"Can't stop worrying For the past few weeks I've been having flashing in my vision. It's usually a very small white light that appears for a split second then goes away once I try to look at it. Well ever since that started happening I've like been sent over the edge and am almost constantly worrying that I have a myriad of neurological diseases, from a stroke to retinal detachment to a brain tumor. I've also been having stomach pains like nausea for the past few days but I'm not sure if im making up phantom nausea because I'm worried I have a brain tumor. I also have had some on and off mild headaches but like I said above I could just be imagining it into existence. I went in yesterday for a full eye exam and the optomologist said my eyes, retina and all are in perfect condition. Because of this I am now more than ever convinced I have a brain tumor and am about to die. Sorry for the rant I just needed somewhere to vent.

"A whole slew of problems... Normal? I've been dealing with anxiety since September, specifically generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Since then I've had a few recurring symptoms that my first doctor had waved off to anxiety, but since then have gotten more common. I will be talking to a new doctor soon since I need to get back on meds after my last attempt ended, so I will be talking to them about this, but wanted others' opinions/experiences too, for comfort especially.

I had a huge fear of contracting rabies since I work with animals. I know this is not logical, since any animal that has ever scratched me (I've never been bit) has not had rabies, and since even though I exhibited some general symptoms that happened to line up with rabies, I've been this way since September. So, I'd be dead by now. 

Some of those symptoms are, like I said, pretty general and line up with anxiety-related symptoms. Minor muscle twitching, ""foggy"" thinking, being irritable, trouble swallowing/dry mouth (has never impaired eating/drinking), etc. I also have had a totally random symptom from those, which is sharp, short-lived pains in my chest, and now they're along my lower abdomen and uterus. 

My new doctor has seen me once for chest pains when they wouldn't stop one day. She said everything sounded fine as far as my heart and lungs, I wasn't experiencing limited breathing, and the pain wasn't long-lived and was sharp, not like a pressure or anything. She was hoping it was from acid reflux, which I was having issues with, but after a month of medicine for that, I'm still having that.

Has anyone else had sharp chest pains from anxiety? I've had stomach pains from stress/anxiety, but have any ladies also had pains in their uterine/ovarian area from it?   ",1
"New Here Hey there! So, I've been lurking around for a few days and thought I should I produce myself. 
I'm a 33 year old stay at home mom to 2 boys. I was diagnosed with GAD at 16. I was on medicine for less than a year, but quit taking it due to not liking the way it made me feel (and not liking my dr, so I didn't want to go back). The anxiety seemed to calm down until my second son was born. I had my first panic attack 5 years ago, but thankfully don't have them often. The health anxiety started around that time too. In August 2016, I finally realized that things were getting bad and asked my gp for help for help and was put on medication and started seeing a counselor. Then my husband went through some job changes, in 2017, and of course lost insurance for 3 months each time. Then in October he accepted a job offer that moved us from Texas to the Midwest. My anxiety was behaving itself during the move and I thought that just maybe it would leave me alone. No such luck. By December, my anxiety was a houseguest of my brain that wouldn't leave. I made an appointment to talk to a dr next week, but now I've found out that she is a clinical social worker? I currently don't have insurance, but I feel that my current way of living is just not working and want to go back on the medicine. Every time I feel an ache, pain, tickle, or sniffle, I freak out. Worse, I'm doing the same thing to my kids and husband. I'm hoping to find a bit of community here and maybe one day, we will all be anxiety free!

"Its like I am at war with my heart Hey people. 27m here. I have had panic attacks 7 years ago. I had severe anxiety for a year, then I used antidepressants, got a girlfriend and stabilized my anxiety for many years. I still had episodes of severe anxiety/stress and depression but it never turned into full blown health anxiety that triggered panic attacks and major anxiety symptoms until recently.

I have been very stressed thees past months and I finally had multiple panic attacks within the span of a month. Ended up in the ER 2 times. So as a person experienced with it, I thought I can overcome it more easily and systematically this time. Took some anxiety episodes like a boss, started SSRI(which elevated anxiety so far) and tried to fix things again.

So my last barrier was to exercise as it had been a major weapon for me to overcome my health anxiety. Today I tried to go for a run but was breathless and my chest was hurting(due cold I guess? I don't know) pretty bad. I became anxious and dizzy. My dizziness went on for hours and I think I still have it.

I am 27 and I had ECGs done during 2 of my attacks where the doctor told me it is not a heart attack this past month.

But this dizziness thing and basically whenever I measure my blood pressure it turning out quiet high at around 15 - 9/10 whenever I go to a doctor to have it measured is freaking me out.

I feel like my body is getting severely damaged due to my constant high blood pressure and the dizziness obviously screws my functionality. I'll go to a cardiologist regardless. I went to one 6 months ago and he told me all was fine before I was having these attacks.

But is it possible to have dizziness and hbp that often with anxiety? I can often see my blood pumping in the body when this state becomes very strong. I want to get back to exercising/working out to have a normal life but I am scared that its going to be what kills me...",1

There are no other symptoms.

Should I go to the doctor just to be safe?
And in the event that it is serious, how long can I afford to wait before seeing a doctor?

I'm only 19, and I know breast cancer in young people is pretty rare, but I can't stop worrying that I might be in that unlucky tiny minority.

I'm posting this because I know little on the subject. I know that breast lumps are treated like a big deal, yet logically I know it doesn't seem likely... ",0
"Frustrating set back with HA Looking for some support right now! My health anxiety started in the midst of some real health concerns. I was eventually diagnosed with a tumor in my pituitary and am currently taking medication to deal with that. Even so I developed severe HA, concentrated around having a heart condition. 

I ended up in the hospital once and in urgent care half a dozen times over the course of 6 months. I also went to see my GP several times during this period. Every time an EKG was done and it came out normal. At the urging of GP I went to see a psychiatrist and therapist. 

Iâ€™ve been on Zoloft for about 8 weeks now. The beginning was rough but lately Iâ€™ve felt great. One of my biggest triggers has been my blood pressure, and itâ€™s been weeks since I checked it. I was checking my BP just about every 10 minutes before. I was also afraid to exert myself, but have been able to start exercising again, which feels great. 

Last night things went off the rails. My usual symptoms- pain in my upper left chest, arm pain/numbness, and crushing fear all returned. I checked my BP several times and was only able to fall asleep when I collapsed from exhaustion. I took a klonopin, which I have so I can deal with panic attacks like last night. 

Today Iâ€™ve been feeling anxious the entire day, Iâ€™ve resisted taking klonopin again because I donâ€™t want to become dependent on it. I feel incredibly frustrated. I have come such a long way in the last few weeks and Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™m falling back into my old ways. 

Iâ€™m going back to my psych on Friday but Iâ€™m scared of spending the week in a near constant panic. Has anyone else experienced something similar? How did you deal with it and do you have any advice that can help? Having HA is like living in your own personal hell and I really donâ€™t feel like I can go back to what my life was like before.

"Iâ€™m trying to open up and am requesting some general advice. Iâ€™m nearly 16 years old, healthy and a girl. Iâ€™ve never suffered from anything like depression etc. 

But recently my thoughts have been turning to horrible things. I get anxious about everything and everyday Iâ€™m battling with my mind to stay happy for the universe. I suffer bad when Iâ€™m ill from health anxiety because of my major fear of death. Itâ€™s just getting worse, I sit at night thinking â€˜I donâ€™t want to dieâ€™ and get really scared and nervous. And then I stress over school and negative thoughts overtake me. 

I struggle major when Iâ€™m ill, I canâ€™t help myself but google my symptoms - itâ€™s awful.

My parents donâ€™t seem to get it, I tried opening up about my health anxiety and they just told me to get over it. Itâ€™s not as simple as that. And Iâ€™m scared to open up about everything else. Any advice? ",1
"All of my problems I have had a lot of traumatic events these past few years. Add to that I have always been a bit of a worrier.

On top of that, my doctor told me I could have fibromyalgia (too soon to tell). I also had a superficial blood clot in my leg recently and read online that these can be associated with deadly DVTs.

I am so worried about EVERYTHING. Ever single day I am stressed and nervous. I Google health and read about these things constantly.

I am not sure what I need. I guess I just want suggestions (if you have any) and support. I really lost it after the latest stressful event (death of a family member).

I don't want to exaggerate it, all the muscles are responding, but it looks like the left ones are just doing their job better.

"The fear just keeps getting worse and I need some advice Hi all,

I've had health anxiety ever since I was a little kid,but this past month I have  been unable to manage it anymore.I know that what I feel and fear is irrational and improbable, but I can't seem to make myself truly believe this.
Instead, I just keep googling and freak myself out constantly.


The past month I've been very paranoid about pregnancy(which is irrational in itself my last sexual contact was in october, and the circumstances made 
 pregnancy very unlikely),after PCOS treatment completely fucked up my cycles.Two weeks ago, I had an ultrasound to ease my mind and everything came back negative, which relaxed me for a while.But now I can't stop worrying about an ectopic pregnancy that could rupture at any moment and kill me.The doctor only checked my uterus and ovaries,and because of this I worry that  she could have missed it if it  was ectopic.I've been having a lot of cramps and spasms, pain that goes from my neck to my shoulder and a couple weeks ago I had an episode of really bad sharp abdominal pain that I attributed to bad nutrition and stress.

I know this probably sounds crazy, but I can't shake the thought that there's a ticking time bomb inside of me.I'm really panicked and I just want to move on.How do I deal with this?",1

However, my bowel movements have changed and I've been finding undigested food in my stool, along with other things. I made the mistake of watching videos on intestinal parasites/worms and now I'm terrified I might have some.

She said she was clean and even sent me a test she took febuary 5th saying she was negative. But then she blocked me. Now she could of done that because i pissed her  off constantly asking if she had hiv or she did it because she found out she did and did not want to be sued. 
two weeks after the sex my anxiety kicked in and i thought i had every symptom but a week later i found out that i had a 0.04% chance of contracting it, so it went away. fast forward to today, i am having daily headaches sometimes accompianed my nausa(huge hiv sympom). i had a 98% fever for one day last week and also had a leg cramp one day and sometimes would get some aches in my arm (maybe hiv or anxiety). 

Im scared out of my mind right now. The only reason i had sex was because i was feeling kind of depressed and thought sex would help. Little did i know that i was going to contract hiv from it :(. I will be a medical phenomenom, i can already see the headlines ""17 year old depressed boy has sex to make himself feel better, ends up contracting HIV instead"".

"Testicular Cancer I'm like 90% sure I have testicular cancer.. basically around 3 months ago, i got a sharp pain in my testicle, immediately I got worried as I never have pain there.. so I looked it up and saw testicular cancer, I was shaking, etc. The next day or so I was experiencing symptoms of testicular cancer.. like abdominal pain, chest pain, etc almost every day for like 1 and a half months, so fast forward January I went to the ER because the chest pains were pretty bad, same with abdominal pain, etc. They did an EKG, chest x-ray and a nurse did a physical exam on me.. so for the EKG my heart rate was kinda high, also my blood pressure was high (but it always has been so not really worried), then I had a Chest X-Ray after I did that and got the results back saying ""all clear"".. my chest pain stopped like 10 minutes later still had abdominal pain tho, they did a blood test which also came back good but TC can't be detected in a common blood test. 

After that I got a physical exam and testicular exam, the testicular exam the nurse only examined the sides and front.. by the way I have a lump on the top of my testicle, didn't really tell her about it though but she said everything seemed fine.

So still almost everyday I worry that I have TC.. i'm scared they could of missed something on the Chest X-Ray. I'm thinking about going back to the ER soon and getting a testicular ultrasound. Also right now i'm having headaches, fever and my necks been hurting when I move it for about a week..

"Brain Tumor Worry Hey everyone! I'm so glad I just found this sub because I've been struggling with health anxiety for almost my entire life, although it has gotten worse over the past two years. Usually I worry about stomach viruses and things related to throwing up, as that is my worst fear, but I've also worried about appendicitis, a stroke, epilepsy, leg cancer, and right now, a brain tumor. My health anxiety has had a profound effect on my life, especially in my transition to college, and it often limits me from eating, going out with friends, and even leaving my room.

I get migraines often, but my most recent headache is a little different. Yesterday, I had this weird pressure feeling on the top of my head, and eventually got one of my normal migraines. It went away this afternoon when I took two Advil, but the pressure feeling is still there. I don't know how to describe it, it's not really a pain but it just feels weird and a brain tumor was my first thought. I haven't had any other typical brain tumor symptoms, but I have been getting nosebleeds recently, which I've heard can be related to seizures.

People have told me not to be ridiculous because brain tumors are so rare. I know brain tumors are uncommon, but I've known three people that have had brain cancer, one of whom passed away about a year and a half ago (I didn't know her very well but it was still incredibly sad.)

"It looks like I've found a home. My anxiety is ruining my life Hello everyone! So I have been suffering from severe health anxiety for years now, it's about my heart. When I was 18 I fell down the stairs in my house and when I got up my heart was beating totally out of rhythm seeming at random, turned out I had A-Fib and I had to get shocked (twice) back into normal rhythm. I am 22 now and have never gone back into A-fib but from what doctors have told me it's only a matter of time and usually it gets more and more common until it's always there. This scares the shit out of me.

So now I'm scared of getting these SVT's and since I'm scared of getting them I'll panic and actually get them. Just a giant negative feedback loop. I'm on cipralex for anxiety and have been for two years but just learned from a pharmacists that it can cause even more heart rhythm issues which is the source of my current anxiety attack, since the cipralex doesn't help at all anyways.

"Heart anxiety for no reason Hello all,

First post on here, there's some really good advice from people in here so hopefully someone will have been through something similar to me. 

I just wondered if anyone else has the same thing as me. I am anxious about having a heart issue, every day, and this doesn't seem to be based on anything at all. There's no family history, I'm relatively young (32), have had all the heart checks available with nothing being found, my cholesterol is fine, and I can do mild exercise with no pain (I'm pretty unfit and just started doing exercise so I'm at a mild level). I threw away my blood pressure monitor because I think it was feeding my anxiety but when I used to take it, it was always in the normal range. 

But every day, I'll feel my heart beating in my chest at random times. Sometimes when I'm lying on my side, and in certain positions on the sofa. Sometimes I'll feel a strange vibration feeling in my chest. Or I'll feel my heart beat normally, then seem to stop, then thump back into rhythm. My partner will put her ear to my chest and tells me it's beating normally but to me, it feels like it's thumping and missing beats.

When I get any of those sensations, I'll worry about what it means and I'll feel panicky, especially if I'm on my own, or in a situation that I can't escape from, such as a plane or recently, on the London Eye ferris wheel. Maybe it's the thought of help not being easily available to get to me. The current snow in England is making me a little panicky that help won't get to me.

Along with those weird heart sensations, I'll get chest discomfort, like a heavy indigestion feeling, sometimes odd feelings in my arm, sometimes light headed feelings. None of it is painful, it's just like weird sensations. 

I've attempted to put my chest sensations down to digestive issues such as acid reflux and I've tried eating better and exercising to improve my health but so far, it hasn't made much difference.

I don't know if there is something going on that no one can find or whether I'm literally doing it all to myself.

I'm not an anxious person normally. I can talk in public, I'm not socially anxious at all, it seems to be this one and only issue and I've no idea where it came from. 

Does anyone else get these feelings, and if so, how do you ignore them and how have you managed to reduce them? ",1
"The flu is going around really badly at my university and I'm terrified of catching it I'm really freaking myself out a lot. I have a good immune system, I normally only get one cold or so a year, haven't had the stomach bug in almost 7 years (knock on wood), and I don't think I've ever had the flu (but maybe a flu like illness or two).

Anyway, I'm always health anxious about things like this, but it got a lot worse last week upon receiving an email that the flu is widespread and that they've been getting a large amount of cases. People in my classes claim to have it, people in my clubs claim to have it, etc. Luckily none of my five roommates (we live and share a bathroom together) have gotten it so far, but I'm still so freaked out. I obviously go above and beyond with precautions- hand washing before any kind of eating or touching my face, probiotics, Vitamin C immune supplements 1x a day, lots of fruit, water, sleep, not a lot of junk food, exercise. I clean the doorknobs every day and sanitize my phone and laptop daily. I still can't help but worry.

I've been taking my temperature a lot and feeling feverish but it never comes back with a fever. I've also had some trouble sleeping and I've been nauseous, had a funky appetite, and some questionable poops. You can catch the flu through air droplets so that's the only way I think I could ever get it but I'm still really freaked out.

Any advice on how to try and relax a bit?",1
"I feel like I am okay I feel like I am okay in the sense that I feel stable when I think about my mental health as well as my emotional health. Physical health I am satisfied with even though I have slightly more fat than what I desire on my body. Regardless of these things I seem to be feeling well yet throughout some of my days in the week I feel anxious about something and I always get the feeling that it's regarding one of the three things I mentioned earlier (mental, emotional, and physical). 

More often than ever I feel like the problem might be anxiety. I'm not sure how to deal with it or what preventative measures I can take. I'd much rather read or listen to people who have been going through the same scenario as me than to approach a health councilor. 

Any sort of feedback on the things that I can do or maybe even some controversial practices I can try would be of great help.. hopefully


Thanks guys and gals! 


P.S. I feel like my anxiety is not on the level where I would need to start taking medicines for it. I would say that it is on a small level.

"2 Swollen Lymph Nodes...still freaking out About 2 weeks ago, I noticed a pea-sized growth under my skin in the inguinal groin region, then another. Was mis-diagnosed at first as a hernia, went to doc and they said if i threw up, go right to er. 

Next morning, threw up 3 times (from anxiety probably), went to ER. They poked me, said ""these are swollen lymph nodes, better order some tests."" So, I got bloodwork, a CT Scan and an ultrasound. Lymphoma, or another cancer is my ultimate fear. 

Everything came back normal. Just two enflamed lymph nodes on the CT Scan. They diagnosed it a probable bacterial infection, maybe given to me by the cat I got a week before all of this started. Gave me antibiotics.

So I am about two weeks out from that, finished my antibiotics and the nodes are still the same size. Have been to GP twice since the ER, thinking I felt more nodes, he said all seems normal, and it could take a month for the nodes to go down, and they may never go down. He says he doesn't think I have lymphoma and is almost convinced fully of it. 

Made the mistake of reading that only a biopsy can detect cancer, so have now convinced myself I have cancer somehow, despite 3 ER docs and a nurse telling me it probably wasn't. The nodes are still about the same size, maybe bigger, but not by much. This is kilin me.

edit: the doc and er doc say they are too small and superficial to even biopsy right now, which makes me feel even dumber. ",1

"Heart/Diabetes anxiety for 4 years Last night when I couldn't sleep I started reading this subreddit and immediately felt some what comforted that I recognised myself in some of your stories. I thought I would share mine and get some of your imput. I think it would really help.

When I was 23 and finishing up a very stressful period of writing my thesis I woke up one night completely convinced I was having a heart attack. I managed to calm myself down but every since then not a day has gone by where I don't think I could die at any second. For the most time I worry about my heart. I got pains at the top of my stomach, like someone pressing two fingers right under my ribcage, which the doctor said was acid reflux but in my mind it is always the worst. One time, years ago, I heard a commercial on the radio where a woman said ""I thought I was just gassy, turns out I was having a heart attack!"". I turned it off right away but I couldn't get it out of my head. Especially when I learned that heart attacks in women can present as stomach pains/acid reflux. Everything I feel is related to my heart. Checking my pulse constantly is the new normal. It's completely exhausting. My father has since died from a heart attack and my uncle has had many stents so that its in my family history also doesn't help.

My other main worry is about diabetes. Because my dad was very overweight, I grew up with the family doctor telling me that if you are too heavy you Will get diabetes. Now, even more so after his death, I am completely terrified. I monitor how often I pee every day and if its more than usual I freak out. I get tested every couple of years but months after the last test my mind will go to 'but what if you do have it now. It will all be your fault. You did this. You're sick and it's your fault.'

She suspects that I might have idiopathic intracranial hypertension. She's seen this a few times. Sets me up with a specialist. Specialist calls and sets appointment some time in April. Today, I get a call saying that appointment was a mistake and they need to see me next week. They used the word ""serious."" My mind is racing now. I'm trying to calm myself down and think clearly, but I can't. They're not going to diagnosis me with IIH (which is a benign disease), it'll be terminal brain cancer or MS. I just know it. Basically, IIH makes your brain swell due to excessive spinal fluid. It gives you nasty headaches. Weight loss and meds are the treatment. I'm going to die of brain cancer at 28. This is how my life ends. This is the most convinced I've ever been in my entire life and all the history of health anxiety that I've had. This will be the end.

"Issue with Anxiety and Throat Hey guys, 

First time posting but been dealing with anxiety for a while... A lot of my anxiety goes to my health... 3 years ago I began to have these extremely painful sores in the back of my throat. Went to a bunch of doctors and they couldn't tell me what was happening (they said it was stress). I also got oral thrush in my throat and mouth along with headaches, stomach aches, flu and cold symptoms. I began to get extremely anxious with everything that I spiraled out of control. I landed myself in a psychiatric hospital by the end. I almost lost my job, my wife, and my life because of it. Turned out I wasn't crazy but was having an adverse reaction pyhsical and mental to mold in our apartment we had recently moved  into before my symptoms popped up. Every thing gradually got better, my anxiety went way down... my health returned....But the one side effect was my throat became extremely sensitive. It easly scratches and a white scab will form while it heals. But my anxiety self that pops up during this time will freak out and go into PTSD mode remembering all the bad memories. I impulsively have to check my throat  and look at any injuries a lot during the day and even sometimes take a Q-tip and touch the area and see if the scab come off just to make sure it isn't one of those sores like before. 

Anyway I just wanted to know if anyone has gone through something similar and of anyone has some coping techniques that might help (yes I see a therapist and whatnot as well). Getting sick or feeling like I'm getting sick extremely stresses me out as well because of these issues. 

Thanks everyone!",1
"Can't stop obsessing.. Any tips? Sorry if this is a little long, but I'm new here and desperately looking for some advice. Plus it kinda helps to get it all off my chest.. 

I've been struggling with health anxiety for a little while now, and although I keep kidding myself that I'm in control, I don't feel very in control. I can't stop the constant worrying and obsessing.

It all started just over a year ago, when I spent a week in hospital. I'm not going to go into detail as to why, as I don't want to trigger anyone else's anxiety... But it wasn't a great week.

Since then, I've been fine. I have ibs, which is unfortunate as the symptoms I get seem to really trigger my anxiety. But that's the most serious problem I have. A few other minor things, asthma, skin problems, but nothing unmanageable.

I noticed my anxiety levels shifting around a year on from my hospital stay. Think it must have just been on my mind, then I had a really bad ibs flare up that threw me. Was off my food, had no energy and lots of other unpleasant things.

Ibs is more under control now, but my anxiety is not. I feel anxious in general, have quite a foggy head alot of the time, don't really feel like myself, don't want to do much, getting tired out easy, feel like crying alot. But mostly I'm struggling because I can't stop obsessing about every little thing wrong with me.

The slightest cramp or ache sends me spiraling into a panic. I can't stop googling things to find out if there is something wrong with me. Even though I don't really have any ongoing symptoms and they are more one offs. Can't stop poking and prodding looking for lumps or enlarged lymph nodes.

Any time I find the tiniest little lump (found one or two in the fat layer on my stomach) I obsess. Can't seem to stop looking for it to see if I can find it again. Most of the time I can't, any if I find anything it's tiny so logically I know it's nothing to worry about. But I just can't stop.

It really feels like it's taking over. I just feel like I'm stuck in an endless obsessive cycle of prodding, being hyper aware of every tiny sensation, looking for things wrong with me a constantly googling.

It's got to the point that when I have a nice symptom free day, I find myself looking for something that's wrong with me as I feel like i can't trust that I'm actually ok.

Anyone got any advice, or been in a similar situation? This isn't something I find easy to open up about, but I'm scared it's going to completely consume me if I don't do something. ",1

"Convinced I'm dying from visiting auto body shop Hi everyone,

So basically Iâ€™m freaking out because Iâ€™m thinking about how I used to visit my estranged dadâ€™s body shop from time to time growing up during the summer. I canâ€™t imagine that I would have gone more than 10-15 times or so in a given summer, and some years I probably only went a couple of times, others none at all.

I would go to work with him to wash/vacuum cars, answer the phone, and sometimes wetsand cars. However, there would be times where I would follow him around to his back shop to check on his employees. Or, I would go back there to let him know that a customer was waiting for him. Iâ€™m currently freaking out bc I canâ€™t imagine that being in that environment while guys were doing work could have been good for me, even though I wasnâ€™t doing any sanding or painting myself. His back shop is rather large, and he would keep his garage doors open for ventilation https://imgur.com/FviJwNq see building on the left). I think I remember a couple of times in the winter I was there and he had the doors shut though. I probably opened the door to the paint booth a handful of times to scream in there that someone was waiting for him.

My biggest fear is that Iâ€™ll wind up getting cancer or something years down the line from now. I probably first went to his shop when I was 5, and stopping visiting after I was 18 or 19. I have no idea how secondhand exposure to this stuff works. Does this limited secondhand exposure to dust/paint as a kid pretty much guarantee problems down the road? Or does that typically require years of direct exposure?

Was my dad 100% in the wrong for letting me come to work with him in the first place? Part of me thinks that its quite common for kids to go their family-owned businesses, but still.

Itâ€™s gotten to the point where these thoughts dominate my mind, and its very difficult to care about anything, since I feel like Iâ€™m dead anyway.

I think its entirely possible that Iâ€™m overreacting, and this anxiety is brought on by the fact that I just graduated college and started my first job.

Can someone please let me know what they think?

Edit: I found some pictures of his shop so that you can see what the environment was like, for what its worth https://www.facebook.com/pg/Sudden-Impact-Autobody-INC-161287353937984/photos/?ref=page_internal",1

"Worried about ovarian cancer Hello,

Iâ€™m new to this subreddit but deff not new to health anxiety.  Iâ€™m 26, and 5 years ago my gyno basically diagnosed me with PCOS. My periods have been irregular for the better part of 5-6 years but lately have been regular...maybe a few days off. 

Well last month, my anxiety started to get really bad. I was having panic attacks daily and didnâ€™t sleep well. A few days ago I started worrying that I have ovarian cancer bc I was bloated. It ended up subsiding but now my period is â€œdueâ€ (meaning this date range is when I usually get it) and I have lower back cramping, pelvic cramps, bloating but no bleeding. So basically Iâ€™m worried that itâ€™s OC. Iâ€™m also thinking it could possibly be because of stress but Iâ€™m not sure

"Iâ€™m experiencing calf pain after a loonnnggg bus ride. DVT? Hi everyone, 

First of all, Iâ€™m a 27yo female who is pretty active and in general good health. I am taking oral contraceptives so I am at a higher risk of clots. Iâ€™ve been taking the same birth control pill for 10 years without any trouble. 

I recently went on a trip and was on a bus for 15 hours straight. I did walk around or stand up every few hours or so. I also had the seat next to me for myself so i was able to extend/raise my legs and stretch out. I was very hydrated during that trip. 

Once I got to my destination, everything was okay. I had to get back on the bus to go home, which was only going to be 5 hours (the first one took so long due to weather/traffic). I walked around about half way through my return trip, but i did notice my lower legs started to hurt towards the end of my trip. Also, i admit, i definitely wasnâ€™t drinking as much water as i probably shouldâ€™ve. 

Itâ€™s been 24 hours now and Iâ€™m experiencing mild pain in my lower left leg. My calf just seems crampy.  It hurts a little when i flex my toes up to the sky (that also hurts on the other leg as well). I do feel slight muscle spasms in my other leg but no pain. I have no noticeable swelling or warmth on my legs. The crampy feeling sort of extends to my thigh as well, but i do have sciatica so Iâ€™m not sure if thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m feeling. I can walk totally fine and have no pain when doing so. I mostly feel this pain when i am sitting or laying down. 

Iâ€™d love some advice on whether or not i should go to the ER to be safe or if itâ€™s just likely my muscles are dehydrated and sore from being stuck in a relatively small area for a while. ",0

"Itchy vagina - anxious nighttime scratching NOT STI related. Advice wanted. I scratch my vagina - a lot. I do it most before bed and often wake up in the middle of the night scratching. I scratch when I'm watching Netflix and anytime I'm 'idle.' I get the urge to scratch sometimes at work, but very rarely when I'm busy or out having fun.

I've been tested for STIs and yeast and bacterial infections many times, it's none of these things.

The scratching problem also affects my anus but to a lesser extent.

When I get the urge to scratch, it's like a twitch that I can't ignore. Once I start scratching I find it very hard to stop. I feel relief when I scratch until I scratch so much that I tear the skin and it begins to hurt and bleed. When I'm scratching I notice that I'm usually holding my breath and my body is tense.

My suspicion is that it's an anxious behaviour and now that I've suffered for over 4 years, it's become an unconscious 'tick' that I can't kick.

I tried acupuncture and only experienced a mild improvement from 1 of my total 5 sessions. The improvement didn't last.

Has anyone else suffered from this condition? Any and all advice/personal stories would be so very appreciated. ",1

"Inhalated AC/refrigerant chemicals Today, I was in sitting in a lounge area of a building at my university for about 10 minutes. All of a sudden, someone (who happens to be the professor of a class I'm in) walks by and asks ""Does it smell like burning plastic in here to anyone else?"". I took a whiff, and lo and behold, there was a *very* strong odor. A repair man eventually determined the problem to be that the HVAC system was leaking fluids into the ventilation. I left the building soon after the professor made his remarks, but I did return briefly a couple times to see if it had gotten better and to retrieve the laptop I left there. 

Since then (this was about an hour ago), I've kinda been feeling a weird sensation in my lungs or possibly my esophagus (not sure). How worried should I be about chemical inhalation, etc.?",1
"I don't wanna jump to conclusions, but I'm a little worried about diabetes Just recently I have started to have trouble sleeping. My schedule, and everything has been a little messed up. I sleep for like 3 hours wake up, and can't go back to bed for a couple of hours while I feel decently thirsty, and hungry. Eventually I fall back asleep for another couple or hours, and wake up, not able to sleep until the next time. So after I have finnaly accumulated a normal amount of sleep I will eventually get up, but I don't really feel that great, but I don't necessarily feel that bad. 

For the past two-three days it seems to have been weird. The first day it was the same cycle except I woke feeling pretty aweful. Headache, not well rested, and tired. The second day I didn't really get a full 7-8 of rest, so for most of the day I felt like I was on the verge of falling asleep if I had any downtime of not doing really anything. That night I decided I would get a full night's rest in one full go as usual. I fell asleep pretty easy, but I woke up like 4 hours later having to pee pretty bad, and feeling thirsty. I was able to immediately go back to bed though. I awoke 3 more hours later, feeling as if I have to pee again, not as bad this time, BUT my thirst was pretty intense. I chugged some water, went to the bathroom, and gone back to bed. 

So I'm kind of afraid that this could be diabetes or something. I'm not overweight, but I'm definitely not active. My eating habits aren't too great either. I eat good foods, but most definitely eat a lot of bad foods.

TL;DR: I'm not sleep well. Waking up in the middle of the night feeling thirsty, and having to pee. Thirst exclusive to night. ",1

"I could use some reassurance. Swollen lymph node, getting a biopsy Friday I have been having reoccurring sinus infections due to a tooth that needed a root canal. During that time, I went to an ENT who told me that my nose was a bit crooked and that was another reason. 

While I was there I thought I'd ask him about a lymph node in the back of my neck. When I first discovered it I thought it was a knot in a muscle so I tried to massage it out but it never went away. Eventually, I asked my GP about it and he said not to worry unless it grows. I don't think it has.

I told him that it had been there for at least 2 years but more likely 3-4 years. He asked if it was stable and I said yes but he wanted to get an ultra sound. 

The ultra sound tech said she thought it was just a lymph node. I asked if she thought there was cancer in it, and she didn't think so but would let my ENT make that call. 

I went to the follow up and he mentioned the ultra sound doctor thinking it was a lymph node but wanted to get a needle point biopsy on it. He said that 9/10 times it was nothing but he would be a bad doctor if he didn't check. 

This triggered my health anxiety. What if I'm that 1/10? My brother had lymphoma when he was 27, and I'm 31. So I'm terrified. 

I poked it, and it got harder, and my neck got sore, and now I can't stop checking it even though I know I need to. I'm trying not to push on it and just brush my hand across it, but it's still there and it's still freaking me out. 

A few weeks ago I had a routine physical and my blood work was normal. My white blood cells were high but they were at 8 and the range was 1-10 was normal. My GP didn't think anything was wrong aside from minor cholesterol stuff that he put me on vitamins for.

So I'm getting the biopsy on Friday, and following up on Wednesday to get the results. But in the meantime I'm spiraling here and looking for reassurance or help.

I could feel a swollen lymph node just under my jaw over my carotid artery.  what started to scare me, is that i realized I could feel that lymph node for something like 3 *months*.  My doctor immediately ordered an ultrasound, and this morning I got a really somber call from a nurse at the Dr.'s office saying I needed to see an ENT right away: I not only have the one, but *multiple* enlarged lymph nodes in that area.

"(vent) I probably got cavities from grinding my teeth for years and i'm fed up with being so anxious all the time This is my first post here, i just recently found this subreddit and it already helped me a lot just reading everyones posts. I always felt like i was completely alone in this, as my close family and friends are usually brushing me off. Also i apologize in advance, i'm not a native speaker so my english might be a bit off at times.

Anyway, the main point of this is to just... put my feelings out there. I'd guess a few of you can relate. I hope this won't be too much, since i do tend to overshare when i'm depressed and i am depressed at the moment.

I've been anxious and obsessive ever since i can remember. Couple of years ago i was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and major depression, as well as BPD. Two years ago i was also diagnosed with AvPD and OCPD. I went through DBT two times, a third time is already scheduled. I was in therapy for over 5 years, but i have to quit. I've also been on Pregabalin for two years.

Health Anxiety started last year for me, after I had finally cut ties with an emotionally abusive friend who basically made the past four years a living hell. I don't know if that was the cause but it happened around the same time. 

I've always grinded my teeth at night and i was wearing a mouth guard ever since that was discovered. However recently i lost mine, as i lost my bag during traveling (which has caused a lot of stress for me over the past week, as losing things is something i've always been anxious about), so the grinding has been worse. 

Thanks to my medication i have a very dry mouth and to top that off i also currently have a very bad cold, that's already got me on edge wether i'm developing pneumonia. 

Yesterday night was a very bad time for me. While brushing teeth my gums were bleeding a lot - i have very good oral hygiene, my doctor has never had any complaints and my gums never bleed - so brushed my teeth, used mouth wash and then went to sleep, trying to not go into the anxiety cycle again. After that however instead of falling asleep I spend hours googling things and being caught up in memories of said former abusive friend. I don't know where that came from, but it just overwhelmed me. 

Today i found a tiny black spot on my teeth, that won't go away. It looks like a tiny hole. And instead of listening to what i learned in therapy - i should've known better - i googled again. Turns out you can get cavities from grinding your teeth and wearing them down. I am fairly certain this is what's going on and i've scheduled an appointment for Monday. And now i'm trying to find ways to get through the weekend without too much stress, because i'm worried that might make my cold even worse and... you all probably can guess how the cycle spirals downwards from here.

The thing i wanted to say about all this is the following: This sucks. Majorly. I am so tired of this anxiety, this obsessive overthinking of everything my body does; i'm tired of all these bad things that happened in the past still haunting me to this day. I'm tired of all the diagnosis i got - it feels like there's no chance of recovery because of all the things i have to work through. And i'm also tired of being aware that stress will wear my body down but that thought alone is causing me so much stress that it's a long spiral i can't seem to escape from. This right now feels like another punishment for not getting this right. I'm trying not to be too negative, but the thoughts keep forming in my head. Sometimes i just wish i could start anew because after i learned in therapy just exactly how all my problems started and how they escalated, i just wish i could redo my life and stop the anxiety before it even got this bad. 

I will continue to work through this. As we all do. I know that me wishing for a new start will never come to be and maybe that wouldn't even be for the best. I know i'm not and neither is anyone else here responsible for this condition. Right now it just felt like the thoughts were overwhelming me and i needed to tell someone. I know this can be beat, i just feel at a low point right now.

If you read this, thank you for listening to me.",1

Long story short, Iâ€™ve been under a lot of stress lately. My girlfriend who I was really in love with broke up with me last week. That seems to be the major issue right now. But Iâ€™m getting some troubling symptoms.
All day, Iâ€™ve had this weird pain in my chest. I attributed this to emotional pain and didnâ€™t think too much of it. Now, Iâ€™m also feeling it in my back and the pain is more to the left side of my chest. I am having some left arm pain as well, and it almost feels like some weakness too, but I canâ€™t tell if this is my mind playing tricks on me. My heart is pounding, and Iâ€™m feeling a little lightheaded. I just feel off.
So, the 2 things Iâ€™m worried about are a heart attack, or something called Broken Heart Syndrome, which is a very real condition and has been proven to exist.
Iâ€™m not asking for a diagnosis of course, but has anyone else experienced something like this?",1
"Stress and Increased Health Concerns? Hey all.

I have recently been experiencing a lot of stress with my job. I mean, a lot. I am trying my hardest to cool down, but I can definitely tell that my body is reacting to the stress. Stress hives, hyperventilating, and all the while an increased worry that these are symptoms of something like lyphoma.

Just looking for some support. Does anybody else find that their worry about having cancer or some other disease increase with stress about other things? Is this just what happens wit health anxiety?",1
"Cat scratched behind my ear Hi all, life long health anxiety sufferer, history of as many as 45 ER visits in one year. Had it somewhat under control but the last 6 months I went thru a very hard time w my mental illness (CPTSD) and is flatingup again. 

Saturday my indoor cat scratched me pretty badly behind my ear (my fault, he hates being picked up). I made her mistake of reading online and found articles of people whose hearts have stopped and died from infected cat scratched. Itâ€™s now Friday and I spent the week completely distracted from my life . Today I was supposed to work a double shift but I was so distracted and anxious at work I just left and am now at emergency. I have no idea how long Iâ€™ll be here prob a long time. I feel like Iâ€™ve created most of mhm symptoms (fatigue - anxiety is exhausting, sore throat, I smoked a lot on the weekend. Chest pains- anxiety. ) I have no fever- just saw 36.9 . Feeling like maybe I should just leave and go back to work as I feel dumb being here but Iâ€™m too scared. Ughhh ",1
"Scared of Klinefelters I seem to have alot of the symptoms for it, low confidence, Insecure and anxious and emotional, I didn't fit in and I admittedly have some feminine behaviors and I can't grow that much hair. (im 17 though, I have hair on my lower feet and the hair on my arms are coming in I guess), I got wide hips but I got big shoulders and I'm tall. I can only grow facial hair on mustache and chin though (it takes a month or two to become somewhat fullish looking) but my dad didn't grow facial hair until he was 22. 

As a kid I was described as somewhat masculine, never picked up girl toys and etc but I guess that doesn't really matter. 

The doctors diagnosed me as autistic when I was 7 and people sometimes confuse Klinefelter behavior for autism but I have a high verbal IQ and I can type fast. My IQ is 100 but Idk. 

I'm going to get my testosterone tested soon this Monday (i'm hoping, i'm going to ask the doctor about it.) But I'm really terrified and anxious, because this would mean everything I thought in my life up until now would be a lie and I also wont be able to have any kids which is the number one thing I want in life is to have kids. 

The symptoms of Klinefelters seems to vary so I'm just worried on having it, the only thing I really care is about the most is if I'm able to have kids with my girlfriend. 

I'm just making this post here to vent, sorry if its a bit of a nuisance, I'll delete it soon.

"Really worried about my kidneys. Any advice? I'm a 20 year old male, 5'7"", 130lbs. I got blood work done and it found my Ferritin to be high at 328 ug/L and B12 high at 658 pmol/L and high LDL cholesterol at 3.39 mmol/L. My eGFR is 88 with Creatinine at 105 umol/L and magnesium at 0.99 mmol/L. My urine came back negative for protein, blood and nitrite. A week later I had Ferritin tested again and it was 427ug/L.  I also had an abdominal ultrasound which showed regular kidneys but a 3mm ployp was found on my gallbladder. It sound be noted that all the test I've done thus far has not been for my kidneys but a pain in my abdomen which I'm seeing a GI specialist for. Should I though look into my kidneys? As these findings from what I've read may seem normal for an older person but not a 20 year old. Also would working out hard just over 24hr before the test affect the results? Or a meat heavy diet dispite a 12hr fast? Thanks

"This morning I found what may be a bald spot, which naturally confirmed all of my fears that I have lupus and Iâ€™m dying. Just an average Saturday! I am so happy I found this sub, if for anything else to know that Iâ€™m not the only one out here. 

I always do this...I work to ignore little things day after day that *could* be symptoms of something bigger, until suddenly I find that one thing that affirms that Iâ€™ve been negligent and now Iâ€™ll pay the price. 

Iâ€™ve been in the obsession spiral since 11am today. I recently gave myself an undercut and I checked the back of my head in the mirror before leaving the house to get lunch and noticed a huge spot of hair missing at my neckline. 

By the time I got to the restaurant I was on a website confirming that I do in fact have lupus and sobbing while playing the conversation in my head of having to tell my mother.

For a moment I break through the cloud and say look at yourself! You noticed what MIGHT be a bald spot and now you definitely have lupus?? Get out of the spiral. Youâ€™re fine. 

Then I fall right back in. How dare I enjoy this hot dog right now like nothing is wrong!? I have lupus for godâ€™s sake. 

Itâ€™s so bewildering how it takes this hold. 

So now Iâ€™ll work to distract myself until I can see a doctor, or the 800th time I check my hairline I can somehow convince myself that the spot has always been there and my hairline is just uneven. 

Thanks for existing and listening &lt;3

"I feel like an idiot for posting here but here goes: Brain tumor/cancer worries I feel like a dummy, but I've definitely suffered from health anxiety in the past(pregnancy scares with my ex, lymphoma scares, diabetes scares, etc) so I'm hoping this is just another case of me being a hypochondriac.

For the past 2 weeks or so I've had this strange feeling in my head. I can't really call it a headache, its more of a ""pressure"" that can be felt throughout my head and sometimes more on the top. I wouldn't say its painful, just a really annoying feeling. I also feel somewhat of a ""pressure"" type feeling in my ears from time to time, with associated tinnitus. I've had minor hearing loss/tinnitus before this headache started, but obviously Dr. Google has indicated to me that this could be a tumor. I saw my doctor about it last week and he said that its more likely a tension headache, but that if the symptoms continued and I was still worried he'd order a head CT for me ( have a physical exam scheduled in a few days). I have no other symptoms or problems, and I'm a pretty damn healthy/active 23 year old.

I guess i dont know what I'm asking for here, maybe just words of support from other people who have experienced something similar? The anxiety over this is killing me, and there is no real reason for me to be so stressed. Am I being stupid or are my concerns legitimate? Unfortunately I'm having trouble trusting my PCP...the lymphoma scare I mentioned earlier was the result of me feeling a lump in my neck which he diagnosed as a cyst (turns out it was actually an enlarged lymph node after an ultrasound was done)",1
"Do any of you ever feel like you break through the anxiety for a minute And then it comes right back? Sometimes Iâ€™ll just be talking with my bf and realize how illogical I sound, which is incredibly liberating to be wrong about my health concerns (since we all assume the worst). I will just cry a lot because itâ€™s like the person I was before my health anxiety was able to break through for a second and hold a mirror to my thoughts. I try so hard to hold onto that feeling. But anxiety is too powerful sometimes and I canâ€™t help googling, asking my bf to look at something on my body, or simply thinking about death.

Even though Iâ€™ve looked up symptoms and have nothing in common with any of them, except for the ones I know Iâ€™m probably just imagining, it still makes me so scared. Nothing to do but wait it out and see what happens when Iâ€™m back in school I guess, hopefully it just all goes away.

Anyone else have health anxiety only about their genitals? I recently realised that about 95% of my health anxiety is about my genitals.

"Can't gain weight? Okay so I'm gonna preface this by saying that I used to weigh almost 200 pounds. In the past year I've lost 50ish pounds, and I'm at a healthy weight for my height. I did restrictive diets to lose weight, but at this point I'm working out so if I gain weight I don't really care because I know I won't gain weight in my stomach. 

There's just one problem. In September, I had my gallbladder removed. I'm not supposed to be eating oily food, but I'm a teen so of course I'm going to. The first month after my surgery, I ate like a pig and I didn't exercise. I lost 10 pounds. I have bulimia, but I'm in recovery and I don't purge often at all (like only 1-2 times a month when I relapse). At this point, I literally can't stop eating. I'll be full as hell but I still can't stop. I've recorded it, and I've been eating about 3500-4000 calories a day for the past few weeks (according to my Fitbit, I only burn about 2200). I haven't gained a pound. All I've done is lost (1-2 pounds a week). I should also mention that I have super low blood pressure (the doctors don't know why; I eat salty stuff all the time). Every time I stand up, I get lightheaded and spotty vision and I have to lean against something. I don't know what to do. Any medical professional that I talk to about this says that I'm ""just a teen with a high metabolism."" But I've had to lose weight in the past so I don't understand.",1

Don't have any pain, no tingling or weakness or anything, skin hasn't changed color, they're certainly not misshapen like varicose veins... But just seeing them has me freaked out, especially a couple thick ones near my ankle bone. It's been extremely distracting, staving off panic every time I notice them.... ",1
"Healthy Anxiety worst nightmare! -&gt; HPV Hi All,

A year ago I found out that I had a wart in my throat ""possibly linked to HPV"". It was removed and biopsy confirmed as benign. HPV, specifically HPV-16 found to be a major risk factor for oral/throat cancers possibly contracted by kissing, oral sex, towels and other methods.

It triggered major health anxiety within me and my life practically ended. I quit my job, I stopped any type of intimate relationships and basically waiting for life to have a miserable cancer ending.

I did about 10 times oral sex in my life in total (about 5 different women) and now I'm certain I contracted HPV in my throat according to the statistics that everyone got that virus.

I don't even know if I should vaccinate (I'm 36) because the manufacturer itself says it could increase the risk of cancer if you already got infected with HPV-16/HPV-18.

Yes I know in 90% the immune system clears it, in the rest of the cases, you are as good as dead.

There is no cure, there is no test and I'm positive I'm headed for cancer. 

I tried doctors, GPs, ENTs, CBT therapists, alternative therapists, nothing works for me.

My life is practically over.

I considered to start taking AHCC pills which women (and some preliminary trial) claim can help clear HPV faster just in case I did contract it (I can never know).

"Does weed trigger intense panic attacks for anyone else? There was a time where I'd smoke weed and it would make me socially inept but also incredibly relaxed and I could just sit and play a game for hours. I haven't smoked since 2015 (though I've gotten a slight second hand high from sitting in a car with my friends)

I recently figured I might as well try some as I've had trouble falling asleep and I don't want to use heavier drugs to get to bed. Well I smoked a small amount but immediately it made my heart beat so hard it almost felt painful. I had a minor panic attack but after a few minutes I went to bed.

This morning a friend used a knife of mine to cut dabs and some dab residue was left on the knife, I figured I might as well gum it and see if it does anything and then go to bed. I awoke an hour after passing out to find my heart rate was incredibly high and it was also beating weakly. I felt tired, dizzy and panicked out of my mind. I sent an embarrassing string of texts to my two closest friends and heavily debated going to the ER. I had drank a fair bit the night before and I take 5-HTP for anxiety and I was worried I'd given myself serotonin syndrome or that my heart was somehow damaged.

After a while I went to bed and woke up 6 hours later, I've phoned in to work and am spending the night recouping but I still feel off. Over the past 3 weeks I've been feeling like I'm going to die somehow. Whether it's by alcohol, serotonin syndrome, a really bad anxiety attack or something else.

It's all coming back to me as my 1 year anniversary of getting HA rolls around (I started having panic attacks at this point last year). This was my worst episode yet and I felt absolutely insane. I can't stand not knowing whether I'm okay or not. For the whole day I once again have been 
 super conscious of my heart.

Hopefully I can fight this off once again, I guess it's going to be an ongoing battle.",1
"Swollen lymph nodes (for years) driving me up the wall. Ugh Hello! I just found this sub and it's so nice to know it isn't just me. 

This month has been full of health issues and to try to make it a long story short, an eating disorder gave me a ton of symptoms that I didn't even consider were from not eating such as really bad nerve pain, dizziness, lethargy, LOTS of weight loss, etc. I was POSITIVE the nerve pain, positioned right over my left chest, was a heart attack and went to the ER at 4am. They did an EKG, a blood test, urine test, a full physical and xray. Everything was a-okay aside from malnutrition and general ED signs.

I started eating regularly and every symptom went away completely. I feel healthier than I have in a long time (go figure. eating helps) and I felt reassured and content for about 3 weeks. This all started on the 23rd of last month.But now, I have a swollen rock hard lymph node under my chin I've never had before that is sore and a few big but squishy ones on the sides of my neck along with the muscles on the sides of my jaw being sore (I grind my teeth, possible cause?) 

Something else that is important to note is I had shingles at around age 15 with very swollen and painful lymph nodes and a lot of them never went down. I'm 22 now and can't remember a time when they weren't swollen and occasionally painful, but for some reason NOW I'm convinced I have lymph node cancer and can't stop freaking out about it because a new one popped up. I also have yet to gain any weight back but maybe it just hasn't been long enough yet. Panic attacks are becoming a regular occurrence. Has anyone experienced lymph nodes swollen for 7 years? I would have way more symptoms than just pain and swelling if it was cancer, right? I just need some reassurance or tips, I think. Thank you so much and I hope you all have a good anxiety free night.",1
"Rabies Anxiety Iâ€™ve had a series of hypochondriac scares over the past few years, but most recently Iâ€™ve been concerned about rabies. About ten days ago I let my indoor cat out in the backyard to sun herself and I caught her hissing at (what I think is) a neighborâ€™s cat that had jumped over the fence. I didnâ€™t want them to get in a fight so I shooâ€™d the other cat away and waited outside for my cat to calm down. After about ten minutes I picked up my cat to bring her inside and she freaked out and bit me. Since then, the though that she might have given me rabies has been constantly on my mind, causing a great deal of anxiety. I know that my cat is vaccinated (she was given a 3 year booster 2 and 1/2 years ago) and the neighbor cat was not rabid. I know that rabies, especially from cat to humans, is very rare in the US. I know that Iâ€™m being absolutely ridiculous, but knowing that doesnâ€™t help. I keep thinking maybe the booster wore off prematurely, or the neighbor cat did have rabies and my cat bit her before biting me. It doesnâ€™t help that I woke up today with a headache and a sore throat, two early symptoms of rabies, and that Iâ€™ve been having nightmares where I loose my mind and become aggressive.

"I'm convinced I may have blood clots in my leg. At the start of the week, the box spring of my bed caved in while I was sleeping. I didn't notice this as I'm a deep sleeper. When I woke up, I realized this and noticed my lower back was in great pain and my right leg felt like it was on the verge of cramping. It wasn't impossible to walk, just difficult, and I assumed it was mostly because of my back. 

A day later, my leg is in great pain and I'm only able to be comfortable in very specific situations. This time, I can only walk a little due to the pain increasing. I still figured it was just some sort of leg cramp waiting to happen, but I kept noticing a pulsating sensation in my thigh and shin. I replaced my box spring and was able to rest, somewhat, even though the pain is very noticeable. 

The morning of the third day, I was woken up by the pain in my leg. I can walk but at this point, it's unbearable. It's as if I'm experiencing a perpetual leg cramp. I look into my symptoms a bit and can no longer shake the fear that I may have developed blood clots after my box spring caved in so I arrange for someone to take me to the hospital (I couldn't drive). This was sheer agony as it has become impossible for me to sit upright. Despite the fact that they recognized I was in great pain, the doctor didn't perform an ultrasound. She told me I had no symptoms of a blood clot and that I just had a muscle spasm. I was prescribed baclofen, meloxicam, and lisinopril *(slightly unrelated, it seems I had high blood pressure on three consecutive visits and apparently this was a cause for concern)*. 

I went home, took the pills, and tried to sleep, thinking all I could do was rest. I wake up a few hours later to find the pain is even worse and my right foot is tingly. I had to get a second opinion. I arrange for a second trip to a different hospital and again, they recognized how much pain I was in and rushed me through. The only problem was...this doctor seemed almost apathetic. I explained the situation and he wanted to know exactly why I thought I have blood clots, and I told him about the numerous articles I read. This prompted a quiet dismissive response (very frustrating because I'm not the type to frantically rush to the hospital out of paranoia alone), and just like the other doctor, he told me I had no symptoms of a blood clot. 

Well...it's the fourth day, I've done nothing but try to rest and now I'm forced to take pain pills, yet I can still feel the pain regardless. What am I supposed to do if I have blood clots? Am I supposed to wait until my leg is the size of a log before it becomes an issue? I mean, shouldn't they have at least checked to be safe?",1

Recurring chest pain for around a month So I started having pain on the left side of my chest on the inner part of my pec towards the top. It happens mainly when I exhale. Kind of a sharp pain.

I had an appoint two weeks ago and had an ekg and blood tests which neither of which showed abnormalities. Im a 29 y/o male who has exercised on and off for most of my life.

I was wondering if there was anyone to talk to about this.  Why do I IMMEDIATELY think Iâ€™m dying?  Why do I feel like Iâ€™ve failed when Iâ€™ve been alright for many years.  Why do I physically feel something and think Iâ€™m for sure dying?

I just want to know Iâ€™ll be okay.  I wish every day I could brush things off or rationalize it better.  I sometimes can and then there are times like this where Iâ€™m freaking out on the inside.

So, today at work I go normally to the restroom and strech my groin since ot was feeling a bit stiff. While feeling the groin with my hand I notice a bump and freak out completely. It's about 2cm long and quite narrow. 
My first thought is obviously lymphoma. I mean how could it not be... I haven't been sick since the first week of January so it can't have swollen on it's own right?? Then I connect the weird feelings in my stomach during the last three weeks to the bump and the anxiety is back all guns blazing.
How do I move on from here?

Tl;dr/summary
185cm tall and 65kg, skinny. Noticed a new bump in my left groin, it does not hurt but is quite hard and about 2cm long and narrow. I have previously noticed two other lymph nodes one in each groin and they feel similar but slightly larger. The only reason why I think its a swollen lymph node is because I haven't noticed it earlier (I dont check my groins very often).

Edit. I think its important to note that I started a new job in a warehouse two weeks ago. I lift boxes, stand and walk the whole day so my muscles are very tense all the time. Could this have something to do with the bump",1
"Hard lymph nodes on mastoid bone and back of neck. Hello Reddit.

Im a 28/male/6'7/200lbs.

For months now I've had two rock hard lymph nodes behind my ear on the mastoid bone. On top of that I've had one right next to my spine on the back of my neck, right around my hairline. I've been having some neck pain and headaches non stop for three months. I've also noticed I have some brownish skin spots in my hairline. I've also noticed if I dig my fingers down in my skin near the node in my neck, it feels like I can grab this round lump.

I've been to the doctors and they brushed it off. they assured me its not cancer,is or anything like that. They me on some antibiotics a few months ago and it did nothing. They're not red, or painful. They're hard and kind of fixed in place. They aren't growing either. They've been the same size the whole time.

I get this is a long shot, but I'm not sure what to do. Could the ones behind my ear be rock hard because it's right on the mastoid bone?",0
"Chest pain insomnia ugh All day I was experiencing intermittent chest pain near my heart. Knowing I have anxiety, I always try my best to give random aches and pains a chance to subside but it gets really hard at night. Now I keep waking up and feeling it, and worse, now I feel this weakness like my blood sugar or blood pressure is off. I just had a regular wellness exam about a month or so ago and my blood pressure is always low so I know it's ridiculous to think I suddenly have some kind of heart disease but oh my god I can't sleep for more than 30 minutes at a time and its killing me! Unfortunately I just moved recently and I absolutely hated the doctor I saw at my union's preferred primary care provider, and they are closed on weekends anyways. So I'm pretty much just stuck stressing and worrying. Please let this go away tomorrow! 

How's everyone else doing tonight? ",1
"Health anxiety in PEAKS So.. Iâ€™m 21 now and I have crazy health anxiety from the past two years. When I was 13 my mother was diagnosed with Leukemia..sheâ€™s fine now but I never came out of that trauma. Iâ€™m really happy to have her by my side and I feel like I am the luckiest today.. but it has left a very bad effect on me. Everyday I feel like I have a disease developing inside of me..

Iâ€™m really really scared of cancer and any life threatening disease.. every week I have a new symptoms to worry about. I have constant heart palpitations. Iâ€™ve tried a lot.. exercised, distracted myself but that fear never left me. 
And now I am at my worst. I feel lightheaded in the middle of nowhere, I have palpitations, disorientation, depression and I keep crying. I have loss of appetite, gastric trouble, chest pains and what not! And recently I just checked my blood pressure it came out to be 140/80 with a racing heart. This has been killing me since the past week. Iâ€™m so scared now that I have hypertension and itâ€™s going to affect my health. ( because when I googled hypertension it showed lightheadedness as a symptom)
I also have another fear.. I canâ€™t get any tests done. Iâ€™m really scared of getting them done bc I feel like theyâ€™ll be something wrong and life can never get better. 
I havenâ€™t been to a psychiatrist yet.. because many people have told me that the drugs donâ€™t help and that they cause other side effects which arenâ€™t good for your body. 
I need help... should I get tests done or go to a psychiatrist??",1
"Sudden severe head and neck pain...should I worry? I was laying in bed when I felt a really weird painful feeling in my neck. It was almost like a stretching feeling. Then the pain moved up to the back right of my head. Now it feels like thereâ€™s some pressure back there, as well as in my neck. Iâ€™m also feeling a bit dizzy and shaky. Iâ€™m really worried that I tore an artery or something. ",1
"So I'm in diagnostic phase to see if I have breast cancer and my doctors won't tell me anything. Okay so backstory. Four (4) weeks ago I found a lump under my armpit. It was hard, fixed in place and didn't hurt. I watched to see if it would go away and it didn't. So I made an appointment with my GP.

When he examined it he found that it was coming off of breast tissue of my right breast and ordered a mammogram and ultrasound which I had Wednesday.

They found three lumps in my breast (not including what is under my arm) as well as my lymph nodes being enlarged. The only reason I know this is because I saw this on the ultrasound and asked the sonographer (sp?).

She showed the doctor my results and they recommended a CT Scan with Contrast and are sending me to a specialist.

I've called to try and get my results from the mammogram/ultra sound but they won't give them to me over the phone (which I understand).

I had the CT Scan today and see the specialist Tuesday.

I'm wondering if this was the process those of you with breast cancer (or any cancer really) went through test wise or do I have nothing to worry about?",1
"Lifelong Hypochondriac/Health Anxiety. I didn't even know this Reddit existed until someone told me today after I posted in r/xxketo about my platelet count. I am 33 years old and started with the HA when I was 16. I went to the doctor yesterday after troubling symptoms for a few weeks. I had a baby 3 months ago and gained 50 pounds, so I have attributed my symptoms to weird hormones and my dieting, but my health anxiety has come back full swing and now I'm obsessing about cancer of the lungs, ovaries, lymphoma/leukemia and stomach etc..I also obsess about my heart rate, lymph nodes, I constantly check my fingers for capillary refill, check pulse, temp, blood pressure and pupils. I have also obsessed about blood clots in the legs/lungs since this all started in 2001. I get blurry vision and dizziness/vertigo often, along with a burning stomach, throat and esophagus, constant post nasal drip, and tingling in my hands/arms and legs/feet. Hot/cold flashes, weirdish night sweat ( hardly any sweating, really) and I have had severe joint pain and swollen, red joints since 2015. It's intermittent and comes and goes. They have done RA bloodwork and gotten nothing, even though my grandmother had RA and my aunt has lupus. 

 Today I got my lab work and literally everything was amazingly perfect except my platelets, which were 384( it said the range is 150-379) and my T3 uptake for my thyroid was low..by 2 points. My doctor hasn't said anything yet, I have an appointment again next week to discuss the results. Every part of me is so stiff and hurts so bad. My joints sear with pain and aching and my muscles are in total knots. I always feel nervous and anxious, I feel nauseated and not even prilosec helps. It hurts to move sometimes. My bloodwork is always pretty much normalish, this is the first time I've gotten something even remotely off. I'm always scared I'm going to die. I feel so vulnerable like I'll break if I push myself or do anything. I have tried CBD oil, kratom, cannabis and then also prescription drugs like Zoloft, Celexa/Lexapro, Ativan ( only thing that ever helped me.) This is the worst condition to suffer from and I wouldn't wish this kind of torment on my worst enemy. I hate this shit. I know ya'll do, too. ",1
"First time poster, never used to be like this! Hi all,

About two years ago I passed out in my bedroom after riding home from work by bike on a cold day. Immediately jumped into a hot shower. Felt dizzy, confused, and then boom, hit the ground. Was kind of half aware half unaware, but then had a killer headache after a bit and slept it off. 

Went to the ER the next day for a CT Scan. Everything was peachy. Went about my regular day for a good 4 months until I was playing league and all of a sudden the cursor disappeared whenever it went past my right eye. I could still see out of it, but I couldn't follow the cursor. Then the text became hard to read. Then I tried texting my mom that I was having a stroke but it came out like gibbrish. Then slow creeping numbness up my left arm all the way to my face. Somehow managed to call 911 and they brought me in by ambulance. Diagnosed migraines. MRI was clean. 

All that happened two years ago. I regularly get these stroke-level migraines with aphasia and confusion about once a month. Every sinus infection is a brain infection, every unsymmetrical feature on my skull is a swollen lymph node and lymphoma. I'm itchy all the time in my apartment, so I've got liver failure. Every minor ache or pain is the worst possible disease. I can't help myself making doctor appointments because I don't believe I have migraines.

My life has been ruined, my personality completely changed. I don't even feel real, I walk around with de-realization daily. Who am I?

WTF is going on and how do I begin to deal? I'm only 29 and by most accounts pretty healthy.",1
emetophobia I'm so tired of thinking about the stomach bug constantly.  I can't even have a normal life.  Im so worried about every meal becoming the one I have to throw up later.  I worry my kids are gonna wake up and be sick with the stomach bug.  It's a constant thought on my brain from the minute I wake up to the next time I wake up in the middle of the night.  The only relief I get is when I have a wake up in the middle of the night and feel somewhat normal and then the sense of dread comes to my brain like...maybe this is my last hour feeling normal and I'm gonna start vomiting soon.  ,1
"Awful feeling of dizziness and brain fog when standing? Just recently, Iâ€™ve been experiencing a lot of dizziness, slight heartburn + stomach aches, and  heat flashes. Heat flashes arenâ€™t exceptionally uncommon for me. I also get a lot of stomachaches. Im not too worried about those. I have bad anxiety in general to begin with, so when I started noticing (around Tuesday or so) I was getting this dizzying brain fog sort of thing I really began to freak out.

 Iâ€™ve never experienced it before and Iâ€™m worried itâ€™s something serious. Iâ€™m chalking it up to stress right now (just had a family death, general school stress, being broke, lack of sleep, etc) but Iâ€™m really worried. It hasnâ€™t stopped. I feel like Iâ€™m about to faint frequently. Itâ€™s weird to describe, but itâ€™s almost like my brain is going a few steps too far ahead of my body. Sometimes vice verse. I  stumble a lot when it happens and often need to hang on to something to steady myself.

Iâ€™ve noticed this is mostly happening when I stand. Itâ€™s not as frequent or severe as when Iâ€™m laying down, which makes it really hard to get stuff done. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s dehydration or a lack of sleep, either. Iâ€™ve been getting 10+ hours of sleep in since it began and Iâ€™ve been drinking as much water and Gatorade as possible.

Has anyone else experienced this? Should I be calling a doctor?",1
"Has anyone else have had this type of anxiety attack? I have generalized anxiety but for the past couple of months, due to the death of a loved one, my health anxiety, which was already present, has skyrocketed. 

Anyway, yesterday I started feeling anxious about something else than my health and then I had some coffee and started to feel sick, like I was dizzy, confused and nauseous. Health anxiety showed up again. While I was walking home I was constantly thinking I was going to die right there in the street and I started crying. I kept thinking ""I don't want to die in the street like this. At least let me get home before I die."". I got home and my relatives tried to comfort me, but I couldn't calm down. I kept crying and feeling ill. I even vomited a little. Anyway, they helped me test my temperature and blood pressure and blood sugar and they all looked fine, but I was not feeling fine at all. Eventually I did calm down, but it felt like forever. And I still feel physically bad, so to say. I have aches and pains all over all the time. I feel like I'm 80 and I'm only 25.

I don't get the normal ""raising heart beat thinking I'm having a heart attack"" kind of anxiety attacks so I'm not even sure if this is anxiety attack. Did any of you experience something similar?",1
"Dull Toothache. Should I go to ER or just wait it out. So on Wednesday I made a steak at home and got a string of fat stuck in between my back right two teeth.  After eating when to floss and pick it out, and digged around for a while.  I think I got the piece out but my gums were bleeding a good amount.  Note I do have healthy teeth and go to the dentist every year.  On Saturday afternoon that tooth and jaw area had a dull pain, made me stay in the night as it was just annoying.  Today woke up and for the first hour seemed alright but that dull pain is now back.  The thing is I am in the army and we are going to the field (woods for training) these next two weeks.   So I won't be able to go see a dentist. Today is my last free day.  Should I go the hospital since the dentist is closed today.  Of course my hypochondria is freaking out because all these things of people dying from un-treates tooth infections.",0
"I feel I'm becoming obsessed with the fear of being diabetic. Don't really know how to stop thinking about it. If this belongs more on r/diabetes I apologize and I'll remove if needed. 

TL;DR: Been scared of being diabetic since 2016 and got myself tested twice since last year. They found nothing, but because of my anxiety, I can't stop obsessing over it, wondering if i really do have it and they just misdiagnosed me and I don't know what I can do to trust the word of the Doctor or stop obsessing over it all. 

Over the past year or so, since 2016, I feel I've been fearful over being a diabetic. It's scary to me. Back in 2016, when I was having some frequent urination problems, I went and looked it up(Big mistake, I know...) and saw that they were possibly linked to things like diabetes, anxiety, prostate cancer I think I saw also..and diabetes was the one I started to worry the most about. So I looked into the other symptoms and started to piece together in my mind that I might have it. 

After some fighting with myself, I went and got myself tested. Blood test showed nothing and I was able to relax and calm myself, and it felt like the frequent urination problem I had stopped after hearing that.
 
The problem came back though in last November. In December 2017, I got myself tested once again for it, this time they gave me a urine test. Saying that they would do a blood test if the sugar in it was high enough. Which did worry me a little because it wasn't what I was used to seeing with diabetic tests, but I did my best to trust it.  They didn't need to do the blood test and said that things were okay.

Then this year, I felt i started to doubt it, thinking I was being misdiagnosed, that the test wasn't accurate enough and that I do have it, they just haven't figured it out yet.

I feel I'm gonna go back to my doctor's for a 3rd time to get tested because I'm waking up at night to urinate. But I don't know how to stop obsessing and panicking over this. It feels like every time something minimal goes wrong with my body. My mind is sent into overdrive, thinking it's something truly awful going on with me. 

I was diagnosed with anxiety, I know that much. So much that it feels like it does effect my day to day life a bit. I'm gonna try and get some therapy for it hopefully soon. ",1

"new here and need support Hello,
I am a sufferer of health anxiety and have been learning a lot about this disorder recently. I've always battled anxiety and depression but it hit an entirely new level when I was pregnant with my son (who is now 4) and since his birth. Throughout his pregnancy, I was convinced something was wrong with him. I was never relaxed or trusting, despite having a textbook pregnancy with no issues. 
Since his birth, I have been obsessed-- and I do mean OBSESSED-- with having breast cancer. I have had an absolute terror of cancer my whole life but it has reached a new level of hell in the past few years. I have to say-- and this is me venting here-- I am incredibly resentful of the overabundance of information on the internet about breast cancer because every time I google anything to do with my boobs it comes up as cancer. And it's because of this I have ended up in my lady doctor's office 4 times now, showing her my breasts and the new dimple or vein or whatever that I have recently discovered. 

In my research on health anxiety, I have learned that it falls more on the OCD spectrum than anything else, which makes a lot of sense to me. My fear of breast cancer has become an obsession, taking over my life at times and preventing me from enjoying anything. And the way I ""deal"" with it is compulsive-- by chronically checking myself, over and over and over again, in the mirror with my hands, etc. I feel like I am discovering some new symptom every other day.

Before anyone asks, no, I have not had a mammogram. I stopped breastfeeding my son 4 months ago and was advised to wait until at least 6 months. I have had my breasts looked at and examined and, each time, the doctor has said that things look and feel totally normal. They've also reminded me that by breastfeeding my son past 2 years, I have reduced my lifetime risk for BC by 30-40%. 
I (mostly) know this is irrational, and that my behavior mimics OCD. I am reading books on the subject, and have schedule an appointment with a specialist who uses EMDR for trauma and anxiety. So, hopefully those things will help. I have tried 4 different types of medications and none have worked because, apparently, I am one of the people for whom SSRIs don't work. Lucky me!

Anyway, I am rambling. I guess I am looking for support and stories. Can you relate? Have you found help? I am scared and sad and desperate.",1

"Breast Cancer Worries Hi everyone, I'm sure this is nothing new but I really needed to get it out.


My mom was diagnosed with breast cancer a few months ago and is currently going through chemo. I've had bad health anxiety all my life and my mom's diagnosis has pretty much put me over the edge.


My left breast (same as the one she found her cancer in) felt sore, so of course I squeezed and kneaded the hell out of it trying to feel something. I didn't feel anything other than the fact that it is slightly bigger than the other, which is something I've known for a while but now I'm second guessing myself. The soreness went away with my last period, and then returned this month. Again, I squeezed and checked it compulsively. I cannot keep my hands off it. Always checking to see if it feels better or worse. My SO gently suggested that this isn't helping but I can't seem to stop. Now that my period has arrived, it feels much better but there's still one spot that hurts to poke. I've also lost 70lbs in the past couple years so my breasts don't look great for a 26 year old and I think that contributes to my worry. I'm always looking for symmetry to assuage my fears.


And now I've developed a rash that I'm pretty sure is from stress. It started on my stomach and is spreading. This prompted me to look up inflammatory breast cancer and I've basically given myself a death sentence.  I'm going to the clinic tomorrow to have it checked out but every fibre of my being wants to cancel and just hope it goes away. I'm also going to request a referral for an ultrasound. 


I'm sorry if this is all over the place. I usually talk to my parents about my fears but obviously I don't want to bring this up. Besides the anxiety it's causing, I also feel so horrible and selfish. Has anyone else imagined (or basically given themselves) symptoms after a family member or friend has been diagnosed with an illness? Any suggestions on how to function normally? I'm exhausted from the constant adrenaline rushes  :(

Thank you",1
"Uncontrollable HIV anxiety New to Reddit so I apologise if this post is a little all over the place!

So I've struggled FOREVER with anxiety. I'm a 22 year old girl, whole jadda-jadda about troubled childhood, absent parents etc which I think has contributed to it. Over the past 3 weeks I have been utterly destroyed with anxiety that I have HIV. I've been diagnosed with OCD and depression in the past, as well as always having intrusive thoughts and being convinced that I'm on deaths door after panickingly Googling symptoms.

So basically I met a lovely guy, we really hit it off, going on lovely dates every day for about a week. Then, VERY out of character for me, we got drunk and slept together (every kind of sex, for those interested). I barely remember it and the next day I knew we hadn't used anything because we couldn't even remember how we got home, let alone anything else. Cue a panic just as we went out for breakfast the following day, and I asked if he 'had anything'. He said no, and seemed pretty offended. Well, if he was offended by that, he was even more offended when I said I thought he had HIV and proceeded to pester him all morning about when was your last test? Where do you have them done? How many people have you slept with? 

I physically couldn't eat for days, and I spent the next 2 days having to make myself sick because the anxiety was making me so nauseous. I was shaking constantly, waking up in the night in a hot sweat. In the end I spent 5 hours waiting in A&amp;E until 1am to get PEP. I had to exaggerate to get it (the guys parent's are Ghanaian and Nigerian, he was born in Cuba, but I said he was Ghanaian because I know there's a high rate there). I remember the doctor saying to me ""okay so there is some risk"" and I just started crying. I was exhausted and malnourished and felt utterly convinced at that point.

The guy in question has been so lovely. He knew how anxious I was and he picked me up the following day at 7am to go to the local clinic to prove he didn't have anything. I'm currently taking PEP. All my friends think it's hilarious how anxious I am, but honestly this anxiety is killing me. I can zone out for a good 10 minutes straight thinking about it. I'll think things like, what if I've actually got it from a previous partner? This guy has tattoos, would they test for HIV before that? What if he's taking me on all these lovely dates because he does have it and wants me to fall for him before I find out the truth? 

I had a blood test done at the end of January which was clear, and my blood test from A&amp;E was fine, and I tested negative for everything except a water infection. Even then I was thinking what if the water infection is the start? I sneeze and convince myself these are the flu-like symptoms. I see a spot on my body and I'm convinced that is the rash starting. 

Does anyone else suffer with this? I'm scared that even if I get a negative result that my anxiety will continue. ",1
"Hantavirus Hi all. I have OCD, hypochondria, panic disorder, Cyclothymia, blah blah blah, the whole nine yards. Health anxiety fucks me up like daily, but this week it's been super bad. 

So my fiance and I found a mouse in our room and kept it in a box for a bit because we had just had a bad snowstorm and don't want to put it out there and have it freeze. We've been packing because we're about to move and so we've been kicking stuff up, but haven't found any droppings. Of course after we caught the mouse there were droppings in the box.

"Back pain and worst anxiety day in years!! Crying and scared 33 female. I have been doing really well with health anxiety, not googling, going to therapy etc. NOT TODAY! i am terrified I have some sort of kidney disease or something. Last night when I went to bed at 1 am i was irritated with back pain, sort of mid back no matter how i moved, so I changed my pillow (my old one was giving me neck pain and headaches) and still no relief. I didn't sleep well. I have been unable to function all morning so far bc I can't stop googling kidney failure, infections, back pain etc.  I have sort of all over back pain, mid back, lower back, not sharp but achey and like i pulled something. I can really feel it when i take a deep breath or move. Sitting on my couch right now even hurts. I finally broke down and took ibuprofen. I also keep excessively checking my urine to see if its cloudy and keep moving and touching my back and checking for other kidney symptoms.  On sunday i spend several hours sitting on the floor going through several closets of clothing reaching and moving differently than normal. Yesterday I carried a heavy gaming system by myself from the floor to my car to the post office, I also used my lap top while sitting on my couch to work most of the day and evening....Is it possible this is from weird posture and will go away or should I be going to the ER????

"Those of you that Beat Cardiophobia, I Could use your Help... Hello,

Little bit of background. My younger brother has a weird heart issue. He needed a pacemaker/ICD at 21. Nobody else in my family has it, I've looked into it. I spent a whole summer getting second and third opinions from specialists in the field. I had 24 hr holter over the summer, excercise test and several EKGs. This kicked off my intense fear.

During the late fall, I started developing weird dizziness. I went to the ER twice, back to the cardiologist, everyone deemed it panic. I want to believe them. I'm trying.

The worst thing I've been doing is regularly checking my pulse, and it's always changing. The doctors don't seem to worried though. When I'm relaxed, or even just sitting and anxious, it can be 60. Sometimes it's 107. The more I focus on it, the more it fluctuates. I tried deleting the Samsung health app with the pulse ox but the curiosity always gets the better of me. I felt tired and panicky at work, I had a little coffee, and was surprised that my pulse was 66. Usually it's high when I'm stressed and have caffeine. I made a doctor's appointment and by the time I got there my pulse was 100. I showed him on the app that in the 5 minutes waiting for him to come in after the nurse took my vitals, my pulse was all over the place. 65, 84, 100, 76... He said that was normal.

I just want to be free of this. I want to stop checking and freaking out. If it's high I get scared, if it's low I get scared. The holter monitor averaged my hr at 66. When I'm take it, it seems more like the 70s. I'm seeing a therapist, but the hardest part for me it's believing I'm ok and stopping the hypervigilance and checking my pulse all the time.

I'm not the one who would say no to seeing a doctor, but I declined.  Next time I  hope I don't even need to to go to ER",0
"Ridiculously anxious about my teeth itâ€™s making me miserable. Hi everyone. This is my first post here. Iâ€™ve had health anxiety for around 3 years now but have only just joined reddit and thought Iâ€™d search to see if such a subreddit exists and it does. 

So yeah, Iâ€™ve had HA for 3 years. It was severely bad 3 years ago, I had a lot of stress going on but I managed to get it under control. I used to be so bad, any pain or symptom I panicked and I canâ€™t even count the amount of times I called 999 or 111 (Iâ€™m in the UK) and had ambulances come out for me. I was at the doctors almost 3 times a week. 

Everything has been fine until recently, under a lot of stress again. A lot of uncertainty in my life and may have to uproot and leave my home (for like the 15th time in the past 3 years). Ever since the stress, the HA has crept back in. Right now, Iâ€™m petrified and convinced that Iâ€™m going to lose my two front teeth. 

I havenâ€™t been to see a dentist in the last 5 years since they gave me 2 fillings and I had such excruciating pain afterwards for a few months whenever I drank or ate something too hot or cold I had awful pain up the side of my face. Something as simple as changing my tooth paste fixed it and I havenâ€™t had it since. But I havenâ€™t been in 5 years and I think that itself is what scares me. Iâ€™m not even registered at a dentist, Iâ€™m going to call round tomorrow morning to register. 

My problem is, I am convinced that my 2 front teeth wobble. Well not wobble, but they definitely move if I hold onto the tooth with my thumb and index finger and try to move each tooth. I can ever see it in the mirror (I think). Itâ€™s only slight and itâ€™s not wobbling or twisting or anything like that. But thatâ€™s enough to have convinced me that Iâ€™m doomed and my teeth will fall out.  I smoke so I think thatâ€™s contributing to the fear. Plus I suffer from depression so I havenâ€™t brushed as often as I should because I neglect myself. 

Has anyone else had any similar issues in relation to anxiety about their teeth? Are teeth supposed to move if you try to move them with your fingers? I did a google search (awful I know, I promised myself I would stop doing this) and all the results were about gum disease or forums where people put as the header â€˜I lost my front teeth!â€™ So thatâ€™s terrified me even more. 

My gums seem fine, they donâ€™t hurt, they arenâ€™t red. They bleed when I brush sometimes but thatâ€™s when im really rough at brushing. If Iâ€™m gentle and brush properly, no blood. Iâ€™m so terrified Iâ€™m already acting like theyâ€™ve fallen out. Ive even been thinking that I wish they would just fall out at least then I could be like okay, so now I need to get this sorted. But the whole worrying that it might happen is a nightmare. Iâ€™ve been spending the past week either crying uncontrollably or sleeping so I donâ€™t have to think about it. That is of course unless I have a dream where my teeth fall out which I dream about quite frequently. 

Sorry that this is so long. Iâ€™ve never really spoken about my HA before. Nobody ever seemed to get it and my doctor is in no way supportive or understanding, just acts like Iâ€™m annoying them. My family donâ€™t get it either. My mum actually told me I was deranged when I was in the middle of an intense panic attack a few years back. 

Thank you all for reading. I hope that everyone is well. Any responses will be greatly appreciated. ",1
"Recurring throat issues Every once in a while I get a sore throat or a throat infection/ tonsillitis . A few months ago I had an ulcer in my throat / left tonsil which freaked me out enough at that time but eventually it went away . Now ever since then, my left tonsil seems to be swollen and has stayed this way but with no sensation. Few days ago , got another tonsillitis infection, what to do about this !

"Slightly red, raised spot on the head of my penis For about a month now Iâ€™ve had a small red slightly raised spot on the head of my penis. It hasnâ€™t changed in size or color. It doesnâ€™t hurt, burn, itch or anything. Itâ€™s more of a aesthetic displeasure than anything else. I have had unprotected sex but only with my girlfriend of four years. I havenâ€™t been tested for anything yet. I also had shown my dermatologist and they didnâ€™t say much, just prescribed me a steroid cream. Any thoughts or any one else? ",0
"Have I been having heart attacks?! As of late Iâ€™ve been experiencing pains on the inside of my left arm and frequent sharp pain in my chest to the left of my breast plate. Sometimes the pain radiates across my chest and shoulder and other times it can be one or the other. Iâ€™ve also been experiencing rapid heart rates from little physical activity and high blood pressure. I do have pretty severe health anxiety and also suffer from digestive problems as well so I can be sure if it is just my anxiety manifesting physical symptoms. I went to the ER last week and they said the blood tests showed no signs of it being heart related but my PCP decided to have me wear a heart monitor patch for a week and that made me more conscious of my palpitations and pains. Today is first day since Iâ€™ve taken it off and sent it in. While I was eating lunch (normal meal that shouldnâ€™t have triggered anything) I experienced hot flashes across my body and then the pains started again. Has anyone experienced similar symptoms? Iâ€™m a 24 male who is 6â€™,underweight and pretty malnourished right now from my stomach issues.

"New Moles - Anxiety First time poster, but a long time hypochondriac. 

Itâ€™s genetics - my family has tons of moles, but today I noticed 2 more on my stomach, or maybe 1 new mole and a weird red dot? Itâ€™s making me extremely anxious.  

2 weeks ago I was in and out of the hospital for some strep throat complications which has completely peaked my anxiety.  Iâ€™m only 19 and Iâ€™m indoors most of the time and have no family history of Melanoma, but I canâ€™t help but freak out. 

Theyâ€™re very tiny, one is small and brown but the other may not even be a mole? Itâ€™s the same size, but red and not raised. No pain or itching. Itâ€™s just making me paranoid. 

I have a doctorâ€™s appointment coming up soon so Iâ€™m trying to hang on until then but itâ€™s driving me insane. ",1

"Telling the difference between anxiety and something else? (Upper stomach / throat) So I've had these symptoms for more than a month now...getting close to 2 and I KNOW I'm freaking out about them. Earlier I felt like I couldn't breathe and something might be wrong with my heart and that got all checked out, got normal blood tests, everything was fine and I finally saw my primary care who said my anxiety seemed really bad. So I felt silly for getting over anxious and I have a therapy appointment and a meds appointment and everything to deal with my anxiety. So that's all set to be dealt with.

That said, everything started in my throat/upper stomach and that hasn't really been checked besides me going ""ahhh"" and doctor's looking down my throat (apparently it looked bad at first, but now looks fine). I'm having discomfort (and some mild pain) in a very specific area right under my breast in the center...front and back...the pain mostly in the back, and discomfort in the front. I burp every time I eat, I never burped before at all and the discomfort is worse when I eat and sometimes relieved when I burp. I have mild nausea. I have mucus in my throat, a white coating on my tongue. And this has been going on for the full 1 month +. 

I'm just not sure...is this just anxiety should I try to ignore it until my therapy appt? Is it indigestion or gas or acid reflux or something mild like that (the primary care guy suggested acid reflux, but I'm been trying various remedies for all this type of stuff and nothing seems to help)? Or should I ask to be checked? My doctor does have an electronic place where I can ask a question but I just feel silly since I KNOW my anxiety is bad and it might just be anxiety.

I see discomfort in this area can be related to like an ulcer or a hernia so I guess that would be my anxiety but mainly I just hate feeling so uncomfortable and having trouble eating so if there's any possibility it's physical I'd like to get it fixed!

Does anyone have any advice or similar experience?

EDIT: So here's what ended up helping my acute anxiety. 1) I stopped Googling. 2) I remembered that while I felt sure I had an ulcer I felt sure a few days ago that I had - anemia - thyroid problems -heart problems and I DID get tested for those...and they were all fine, so it's likely this would turn out fine too even though I FEEL so sure. 3) I distracted myself and tried to do something else.

Has anyone tried EMDR for health anxiety? Iâ€™ve got the worse health anxiety/anxiety to where I have many panic attacks and pain everyday. Iâ€™ve tried CBT it did not work. Having a therapist tell me to go to my happy place sounded like a croc of shit lol. Iâ€™ve convinced myself I have MS and that I have heart disease. Those two are the big ones. Any small ache or pain I think Iâ€™m dying. I donâ€™t take meds because Iâ€™ve heard really bad things. Iâ€™ve taken one Xanax which actually didnâ€™t even help. So Iâ€™m gonna try and new technique and wonder if anyone has ever tried it? I also get numbness mainly on left side of my body. Thanks guys! ,1
"Persistent pain in Fibrocystic breast - Anyone have similar experiences? A couple months ago I got a checkup because my breasts have always felt lumpy. Doctor felt with her hands and said they felt like normal lumpy breasts. I got an ultrasound and was told I have fibrocystic breasts. Cool! I could finally relax.


A month later, I literally woke up one day and felt a ""pain"" in my right breast I hadn't felt before. I don't know if ""pain"" is what I should use since it doesn't hurt too bad, but I can definately and specifically feel it, and it's a sensation I don't feel anywhere else in my breast.


Ever since it randomly started that day, months later, it is persistent and I still feel it in the same spot. I'll feel it ""twinge"" throughout the day. It hasn't been getting more painful, but it is a specific sensation in the same spot (although sometimes when I sleep it'll feel slightly painful/more pronounced in the morning, but then goes back to its ""normal"" sensation after I move around. It also hurts when I feel/knead it with my hands, but so do many other parts of my boobs).


During my cycle, my nipples will get sore a few days before my period, and then feel normal again once it starts - that is the way my breasts have acted during my cycle for years. This new specific sensation in my breast is persistant throughout the month, and I believe it's unrelated to my cycle.


Has anyone had similar experiences like this? Any advice, similar experiences, or concerns if something's going on with me that I should get checked out would be appreciated. I'm so mad this pain decided to start RIGHT after I finally got an ultrasound, so I feel obtuse about going to get it checked out again, especially considering I don't know what else could be done to examine it besides getting another ultrasound.

"Worried I have worms in my brains, among other bizarre health anxieties. For the past several months I've been on a huge parasite scare that came out of seemingly nowhere. I even had stool samples taken (again, several months ago) and everything came back negative. But now I'm thinking maybe the samples weren't great. Apparently they do their testing kind of hastily sometimes, so I'm thinking of doing a second batch of samples.

Anyway... I always thought that tapeworms were just an intestinal parasite. But then I read that they can spread to other organs too, including your EYES and BRAINS. Christ. So, naturally, I look in the mirror every day to make sure there aren't any worms in my eyes. I also check my stool with every bowel movement. And now I'm worried that the larvae of this hypothetical worm has spread to my lungs (I've been coughing a lot lately) and brains as well (would explain my headaches, and why I feel so spaced out.)

I've also had to take my cat to the vet a couple times because she was diagnosed with diabetes, so naturally I'm worried about fleas as well now. I just saw some kind of small, brown bug on my floor (one of my cats spotted it) that bounced around a couple times before I killed it. Now, it could've just been a moth that was struggling to fly, but it could've also been a flea. Right? And infected fleas carry feline tapeworms that are even worse than regular tapeworms if they spread to humans.

So yeah, it's 3 AM and I'm going over all of this shit in my head, unable to sleep.

I guess I should mention I'm also worried about going blind, as my astigmatism has been getting worse (and I found out about something called keratoconus, which I may have) and I also have all kinds of pains in my body (around pancreas and liver, especially) so I could also have cancer. Or maybe those are just the cysts formed by the larvae of the tapeworm.

And I do also worry about early-onset dementia and stuff like that, but that's kind of taken a backseat while 90% of my mental energy goes into worrying about worms.",1
"Drove downwind of a confirmed asbestos fire today. freaking the hell out so yeah, there was a major fire in the city today. we had no idea till we were driving up on it. The route I wanted to take was blocked due to the fire. At that time, we had no idea the smoke was highly toxic. So cause our route was blocked, I took a street pretty much parellel to the one we were supposed to take. We drive, and we come across smoke, and drive right through it. I also played the funny guy, and breathed in really hard and said ""mmmm smell that"" to be funny.

Read on the news when we got home the building contained asbestos, and theres an asbestos warning for the whole city center. So yeah, now here we are. I'm in a really, really bad place now.

That said, there are a few things which I guess are kinda making me feel a bit better. We were about 800 feet maybe from the burning building in question, and we drove through about 8 hours after the fire started, and apparently it had been contained by that point.

Still we walked around the city center all day, and drove through it, and waited at a stop light in the smoke. My lungs feel full, and I think my nose burns a little, though that could be becuase later on, at the bar, I stood with my frie ds a few times while they all smoked cigarettes.

And this is kinda gross, but I could have sworn my farts had a kind of asphalt like smell, which I got when I quit smoking, which indicates smoke inhalation of some kind. I guess I could be misidentiying it though.

I dunno... I'm just really scared now.",1
"Health Anxiety gets worse during the winter months? Nice to meet you, I'm new here.

I've been struggling with HA for quite some years now. This last year, I've graduated university and started a new career. Everything's been very stressful, and somehow it's impacted my HA too.

The thing I noticed is that it always gets worse and more intense during the winter months and beginning of spring. I get back pains, my joints start to ache, I feel tired,... which triggers unhealthy and irrational thoughts and anxiety about my health (for the last month I was absolutely sure I had heart problems, lung cancer, an aneurysm, and some other illnesses). It's absolutely crazy.

I don't know, but it's often this way. It always gets worse during the period of january - april. During summer and fall I sometimes get little health scares, but they're nowhere as intense as during the cold and darker months.

Do any of you have the same feeling?

"Does anyone else only worry about sudden health issues? I donâ€™t know how to explain it, really, but the only health anxiety I have is usually kind of â€œsuddenâ€ things that could kill me, like aneurysms, embolisms, all that. Iâ€™ve never worried about cancers, really, or long-term sort of degenerative things. I almost think itâ€™s because itâ€™s the fear of not knowing something is coming. Iâ€™m afraid the X-Ray missed something and that my aorta is going burst or something. 

Like, if I knew something was coming, I would be able to tie up loose ends, spend time with friends and family, take a vacation, and live until I die. I wouldnâ€™t be happy about it, obviously, but I never get very anxious about things like that. The things that scare me are things that could just randomly kill me while Iâ€™m studying or playing video games or something. The kinds of things that just make you drop dead and end up in an article like â€œHealthy 20 year-old dies in sleep.â€ Itâ€™s more of a fear of sudden death for me, like itâ€™s waiting around the corner and I just donâ€™t see it yet.

"Having a difficult time managing my anxiety Hi everyone. This will probably be quite lengthy, so Iâ€™ll apologize in advance. Iâ€™ve been struggling for years with health related anxiety which I â€œmanagedâ€ for a long time on my own. By manage, what I really mean is just deal and push through it. Iâ€™m at a point where itâ€™s more than I can handle now and itâ€™s crippling. 

My mother has had Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis for 21 years and I grew up watching her deteriorate from an independent, strong woman into someone who is now dependent on someone else for even the most basic tasks. I think this is the root of my health anxiety. 

I am terrified of getting MS. Over the last 4-5 years Iâ€™ve had varying degrees of symptoms ranging from tingling in hands and feet to constant headaches. Iâ€™ve had a number of tests done which all come back either normal, or with some other explanation. The most recent being a constant left sided headache and pain in my left eye. My primary care physician ordered an MRI based on my family history of MS which came back abnormal with some extremely small white spots which they were unable to make a diagnosis of. Their recommendation was to see a neurologist and get a lumbar puncture. This was in November...

I live in Massachusetts which makes me extremely fortunate to have access to some of the best hospitals in the country. I was able to schedule an appointment with a neuro at Mass General, currently #3 in the country for neurology. The doctor was extremely nice and listened to everything I had to say. He flat out said â€œI do not think you have MSâ€. He explained to me that MS has certain patterns that show in an MRI which mine did not show. He said he believes my headaches are being caused by a combination of tension from clenching my jaw at night, which I absolutely do, and migraines with aura, which has happened twice. I asked about the lumbar puncture and he told me if I really wanted one and if it would put my mind at ease, he would gladly order one, but he felt it would come back negative. 

I certainly do not want to put myself through that unnecessarily and Iâ€™m afraid it still wouldnâ€™t placate me. He also completed a full neurological exam, which I passed. I left there feeling pretty relieved. That lasted for about an hour. I started thinking about what if heâ€™s wrong?? Heâ€™s basically just assuming this is due to headaches, but he really doesnâ€™t know for sure. 

I really donâ€™t know what to do at this point. My anxiety is out of control and I canâ€™t stop thinking about this. It consumes every thought of my day and it is exhausting. I hate feeling like this. I do have a NP Psych who I see every six months who is very nice and tries to prescribe medication for me, but I can never bring myself to take it. I read the side effects and they scare the crap out of me so much that Iâ€™m too scared to take them. The only thing I will take is Xanax, which usually isnâ€™t often, but lately itâ€™s been almost every day. 

I also see a therapist who also is very nice, but if Iâ€™m being honest, isnâ€™t very helpful. Whether that is my own fault, I donâ€™t know. I originally went to her because I have issues with control and wanted to try to work on that. I just donâ€™t find it to be doing anything for me though... 

I just wish I knew how to RELAX my thoughts and stop being such a worry wart. Iâ€™m wound so tight Iâ€™m ready to snap at any given minute. I get up every day, shower, go to work and then come home and lay in bed until I fall asleep because Iâ€™m so exhausted. I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m exhausted because of my mental health, work hours, or if something is really physically wrong with me. 

Iâ€™m honestly not even sure what Iâ€™m looking for in writing this, maybe I just needed to vent. But if anyone can relate or offer any advice I would be open to hearing anything you have to say.

"Severe HA and a nodule found in my lung yesterday Hey all! I've been on Reddit for a while, but haven't posted here. Basic backstory... I'm 34 female, son died in 2009, was diagnosed with PTSD and general anxiety. Health (in real life) began to fail after his death. I have since been diagnosed with POTS, fibromyalgia, PAC's, diabetes, had two colonoscopies with polyp removal, gall bladder removed, three ruptured discs in my neck and recently had pneumonia at the beginning of February. The pneumonia brought back severe symptoms of HA. They hadn't gone away completely, but I had made real progress. Yesterday I finally went to the doctor after three days of chest pain thinking maybe the pneumonia was recurring. After the x-ray, I was told I was negative for pneumonia but I have a 1cm nodule in my right lung. She said they are usually benign, but of course, I'm flipping my shit. I have smoked for 22 of my 34 years on this planet, so lung cancer is a real, legitimate fear. I have to wait for two months for reexamination to check for growth.

"Brain amoeba First of all, thanks to everyone who participates here. Finding this sub has been a huge encouragement to me as I've realized I deal with increasingly frequent health anxiety. 

My current concern is with the brain eating amoeba. I spent time in a hot tub that wasn't properly chlorinated this weekend. Shortly after the hot tub, I got in the shower and ummm.. picked my nose rather vigorously. After doing so, I thought about the warm hot tub water, so I blew my nose then used saline spray to clean out my nostrils. 2 times in the last 3 days, I've gotten really dizzy and lightheaded, feeling like I was going to fall or pass out. Today, I've had a bad headache and have felt extra sensitive to light. No fever at this point. 

Allow me to think out loud:
- can the amoeba even enter the brain from picking your nose?
- is it possible that the amoeba would have just been in my nostril, then I helped it further up towards the brain with the stream of saline solution?
- would a headache associated with the amoeba come and go or be constant/progressively worse?

I know a much more effecting outlet would have been distracting myself or using other anxiety relieving techniques.. but I couldn't resist venting on here. I'm struggling! I know the questions I posed are mostly unanswerable. Just needed to ask them ""out loud"" rather than let them cycle internally.  ",1
"Years of Random, Sudden, &amp; Violent Vomiting. Anyone Else Have Similar Experiences? I am wondering if anyone else has had similar symptoms and had any luck correcting it? 

I am 39, and have been suffering from random vomiting spells in the mornings for approximately 15 years. I have seen many doctors and specialists without any luck finding a cause. They have performed many tests and everything showed up negative or inconclusive.

It can come in waves but is fairly consistent. For the last two weeks I have thrown up 6 out of the 14 days (43% of the time). Sometimes itâ€™ll be for a few days in a row, sometimes I can go a month without a spell and have experienced it multiple times daily for over a month at a time. The worst was about three times daily for a month and caused me to lose 45 lbs that month due to no appetite.

The majority of the time it happens in the mornings right after I wake up and before I get into the shower. It can happen throughout the day as well at random. Itâ€™s fast, uncontrollable, violent, and usually produced a white foamy substance. However, I had my gallbladder removed in November due to gallstones. That didnâ€™t fix the problem and the docs thought it would. 

Ever sense the gallbladder removal all I throw up is yellow stomach bile. Today it went from yellow to a green color. After getting sick I usually have a pain of about a 4 out of 10 right in the middle of my torso. I find myself applying pressure with my hand to relieve the pain. Usually have to lay in the fetal position after a bad spell without an appetite until the end of the day or night. 

Some of the exams that have been done without luck is Celiac Disease, the breath test for H. Pylori, Barium Swallow test, upper Endoscopy, Colonoscopy, ultrasounds of my gallbladder &amp; liver, gallbladder removal, MRI brain scan for tumors.

Again it happens usually in the mornings, with gagging and dry heaving until something comes up. Usually there is no food or liquids other than the white foam and stomach bile. 

If anyone else has experienced similar symptoms and found relief please let me know.

"Same illness for two years in a row! Need advice Could be TMI but here it goes:

So, this started in March 2016. I started noticing that just before I peed, I felt a sting every time before I passed urine. This when on for 2-3 weeks, then I got really scared and when to the doctor. They prescribed a urine test and also prescribed some medicines for UTI. The results came back negative for a UTI. A couple of days later, I had a really upset stomach with nausea and my roommate had to take me to the hospital. And I mentioned to the doctor about my prior visit. He prescribed another urine test, checked my penis for any issues (I also felt some tightness in my foreskin). He couldn't find any issues. And this urine test came back negative too. I was starting to panic as I the situation was not getting better. So, I had to fly back home to see another doctor( i was in college btw). Another doctor, another urine test and the result: nothing, nada, zilch!
It was same for some more time and then I started feeling gassy along with the initial symptoms. I got prescribed some gas relief medicines and that was it. All in all, this went for couple more months, then the sting before peeing, gradually went away.

So now a little over a year later, in June 2017. The same symptoms returned. And the same progression of symptoms occurred: the stinging sensation, and few weeks later the gassiness etc. But it was worse this time around, I had a very bad heart attack scare with symptoms like pain in the chest, my left arm going completely numb and gassiness. So, I was rushed to the hospital where they performed an ECG. I had a fever too. They concluded that nothing was wrong with me. Oh yeah, I had another urine test a couple of days earlier and it was negative. Amidst all this chaos, I had to travel and it had a 32 hour travel time. So obviously I wasn't looking forward to it. And my nightmare came true. I finished that journey with constant gassiness, nausea and uneasiness. So, I guess I'm not in a hurry to ever take on that long a journey ever again in my life. So, these symptoms finally improved but painstakingly slowly: 4 months.

So, my concern now is that it gonna be April soon, that means I might get this stupid mysterious illness again. What do I do? I feel about 70% just might be my head which is causing all of this anxiety.

Also i feel I was misdiagnosed everytime. The doctors always brushed it off with, ""Your results are fine, don't worry about it.""

"Waking up with a dead limb and worrying I had a ministroke I woke up to pee in the middle of the night and when I stood up my lower body was involuntarily leaning to the left.

I ended up going to the ER after speaking with a nurse. All blood tests came back normal and so did the physical tests. The doctor checked my eyes, walking, reflexes, etc. It's the next day and I can't help but feel like they missed something and that I could have possibly had a TIA (ministroke), which can be a warning sign for a stroke.

"Trying to be a supportive girlfriend of hypochondriac boyfriend Hi all! My boyfriend and I have been dating for over two years now and I always sorta joked about how he was a hypochondriac, but heâ€™s shared some recent concerns with me and Iâ€™ve realized how severe his anxiety is behind it. A few weeks ago he was convinced he had ALS because of muscle twinges. Last night he shared with me that heâ€™s terrified he has liver disease as a result of how much he used to drink in college. He gets down this long rabbit hole of searching through the internet and it drives me crazy because itâ€™s not helping anything. And he refuses to get tested for anything because he doesnâ€™t want it to be confirmed true. 

He has generalized anxiety on occasion and has started to go to a therapist but still hasnâ€™t talked about these types of things with the therapist, which drives me crazy. Weâ€™re in our mid-twenties, live in a metropolitan area, and live a pretty healthy lifestyle, going to the gym frequently and eating semi-healthy. 

Im thinking about blocking sites like Mayo Clinic and webMD so he canâ€™t search at home but I donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s a mean thing to do.

Anyways, can you please share advice on how I can be the most supportive I can be? Or any advice I can share with him?? Thank you!!

"It happened - my first ER visit for a panic attack I just came back from the ER.  It started with some shoulder pain this afternoon and spiraled into a waves of panic attacks.  I was fairly sure I wasn't having a heart attack, but I couldn't be positive so off to the ER I went.   EKG, blood work, monitoring all normal.  Only thing wrong with me was borderline low electrolytes.

I'm on meds but this has been a stressful year in my life.  Consoling appointments are set up, along with a checkup with my doc.

I finally got to the doctor for my annual physical and that was a nice victory in itself. Unfortunately my blood work came back with low platelets and elevated liver enzymes. My doctor had me get retested and those numbers came back today -- and they're worse, so now I'm going in for an ultrasound and more testing to rule out hepatitis. I can't stop shaking and crying. I'm so scared! It's probably going to be nothing but I can't stop thinking about all the serious things it could be. I'm taking care of it with my doctor, but I really could just use 100000 hugs right now. And some chocolate. I just wish everything came back fine instead of having these things to worry about until I get it all confirmed that it's okay.

"Post TC anxiety Hi all,

Just venting some steam off here.

So, last August I â€œfound a lump,â€ I had a CT, an op to remove my left testicle and then on 02 October was officially diagnosed with Stage 2a Testicular Cancer. Since then Iâ€™ve had Chemo, Radiotherapy and as of a few weeks ago my first â€œScans are normalâ€ meeting with the Onco. Hooray!

That said, the health anxiety Iâ€™m experiencing is taking the piss. Every little ache, twitch, twinge, anything makes me worry unnecessarily.

As a result of the Radiotherapy my guts have been a bit iffy since, but a recent toothache caused me to take a lot of Ibuprofen, which together with the Radiotherapy caused me some really dire constipation. This lead to a hemorrhoid. Itâ€™s internal and normally I canâ€™t feel it unless Iâ€™ve sat on something cold in which case it throbs for a few minutes and then stops. Occasionally thereâ€™s a spot or two of blood on my crap, and one occasion I had such a large bowel movement that it turned the toilet water bright, bright red, but otherwise my bms are consistent size, shape, colour and bloodless - they just scratch a little as they pass. Iâ€™m improving my diet to include more fibre so hopefully itâ€™ll sort itself out.

Right now I want to concentrate on the future. Iâ€™ve been given a new lease of life,  but I feel that all the residual after effects are holding me back and the worry over everything my body does is becoming quite a burden.",1
"Letâ€™s talk coping strategies I love this sub. Everyone has been super open and supportive. In my short time following, i have felt a sense of belonging here because all of you seem to really understand how it feels to deal with HA. For me itâ€™s an stressful, frustrating, terrifying condition that leaves me paralyzed with fear and exhausted from sleepless nights of searching the internet for reassurance. I definitely get the temptation to post here looking for reassurance from each other that our symptoms are benign but letâ€™s take some time to talk coping. I would love to know what you do to cope when the anxiety takes over. Perhaps we can help each other cope a bit instead of reassuring each other that we are healthy. 

Iâ€™ve shared my two tips before, the first is to allow myself a few moments a day to think about my worry. I give it space to exist without doing anything to correct it. I recognize that itâ€™s there and then put it back on an imaginary shelf to visit again tomorrow. The rest of the day I do what I can to keep it there. Sometimes I even say â€œno, Iâ€™ll talk to you later!â€ (Itâ€™s worth noting that this strategy doesnâ€™t always work but sometimes days go by and my anxiety has been kept at a manageable level.)

The other one is for full on panic attacks: I pick out 3 things I can hear, smell, see, and if possible, taste. Sometimes doing this mindful activity can give my brain/body the space to rest for a moment.... long enough to calm down a bit. 

Anything work for you?

"Reassurance Hello,

I stumbled upon this subreddit about two weeks ago and since then have been reading it often to help cope with my health anxiety. I often end up laughing at myself over my anxiety. This is my first post and rather lengthy. I apologize. 

My most recent concern is that I have some sort of colon cancer. I have been having unusual bowel movements for several months. Changes in appearance, size, etc. Sorry, too much information. I mentioned it to my doctor earlier this month and he shrugged it off and said to try Miralax. I did, but didnâ€™t notice much difference aside from change in color and more loose. 

Iâ€™ve recently thought Iâ€™ve noticed some red streaking in the stool which has elevated my anxiety about the situation. My employment offers a telemedicine service so I called and spoke to a doctor about my concerns and he said itâ€™s likely IBS and promised I was fine. I follow up with my doctor again this past week and he said the risk is slim for anything major but referred me to a gastro doctor. The appointment isnâ€™t until next month. 

This weekend, I decided it would be a good idea to get an EZ Detect test which tests for blood in the stool. These are little pieces of paper you put in the toilet after a bowel movement that changes to blue or green if blood is detected. You are first supposed to put a paper in to test the water color. I decided to skip that step and test my first bowel movement yesterday late afternoon/early evening. There was no color change on the paper. I was satisfied. 

This morning I decide to do the water test to eliminate any what ifs from my mind. Once again, there was no color change. I follow the water test with another bowel movement. There was no color change. 

There is a control test you are supposed to do at the end to verify that the paper worked properly. It comes with a powder that changes the color of the paper. I flush everything and pour the powder in and then place the paper in for the control test and it instantly turns blue. 

About an hour or two later I feel another bowel movement coming on and I decide to use my final test. The paper instantly turns a very faint blue and I immediately freak out. About 5-10 minutes later I realized that I had put the powder in the toilet and that itâ€™s possible there was some left over in the water even after flushing. I have noticed some little white specks in that toilet throughout the day today. 

I just am looking for some reassurance that there was likely a little bit of left over powder and that my health anxiety is getting the best of me, as usual.",1
"I fainted in a bar. Should I be worried?? I had a cold this past week and was getting better but feeling dehydrated 
Decided to go out drinking and ended up smoking some weed and having 5 beers
Was standing at the bar for about an hour and we ordered some bar snacks, about 5 minutes into eating I felt very lightheaded and nauseous, started seeing black circles, tried to make my way outside to get some air, and dropped to the floor at that moment 
I came to a few minutes later, sat at a table sipping water, and felt pretty much fine other than being kinda tired and still lightheaded

Could this have been just a routine fainting spell? Iâ€™m attributing it to dehydration, since Iï¸ was sick, drank a lot of coffee during the day, and then drank alcohol, without really drinking any water. I also read that prolonged standing can reduce blood flow to the brain. I plan on getting checked out by a doctor this week. Should I be worried?

"Sharp, stabbing pain in head (on top of head) in the same spot every time, can't stop thinking it's a tumor For the past 4 months or so, I've been getting this off-and-on stabbing pain in the top of my head. It stabs for a second and then goes away, and it keeps happening, and it only seems to happen when I open my mouth or talk, or smile. I had a big episode where I thought I was dying of an aneurysm, and went to the doctor and all that and figured out that it was not the case, so I've been through all that, but I still can't help this nagging feeling of ""WTF IS IT THEN??""

Initially I theorized that it must be my headphones causing it (headband is too tight), because the pain seems to be coming from muscles on the outside of skull, as shown by how when I massage it the pain temporarily suppresses. So I switched to in-ear buds exclusively, and the pain went away for awhile. I thought I had won... but now it's back! AGH. Why? And now that I've ruled out headphones as the cause, I am freaking out again. Constantly thinking it must be something fatal. Even though I have already shown myself that it is muscle-tension related (massaging it, the fact that it only happens when I open my mouth etc.) and multiple doctors have assured me that what I am experiencing is not life-threatening. I just can't stop, I want the pain to leave me alone. :( ",0
"fear of rabies hi, i'm new to this subreddit but i've been lurking it for a while so i figured i'd give this a shot instead of other forums. i've been a hypochondriac since i was little but it's been kind of getting worse with age. now something new and exciting has hit me super hard and super fast; rabies!

it comes and goes and my ocd (a whole other animal) makes it worse, but right now it's at one of its peaks. long story short, my (HEALTHY, VACCINATED) dog scratched me and since then the spot on my wrist where it's at has had an internal tickling sensation and, to make matters worse, when i get nervous my throat gets tight and i feel like i can't swallow. i feel like i'm fully going crazy.

i love all my dogs but due to all of this i can't even bear to be around them anymore. i just sit around and cry all day on the lookout for symptoms and trying to come down from all this anxiety and it's almost like i can't trust myself to ""know"" that i didn't contract anything. like 'i KNOW it's all in my head but HOW DO I /REALLY/ KNOW?' or 'WHAT IF ITS REAL THIS TIME' or something.

i'm starting to feel hopeless and like i'll never calm down again. i feel really dumb and embarrassed because i definitely know better but i just... like won't listen to my better judgement. my family and friends are sick of me being such a mess and that makes me feel bad too.

"Nervous wreck (ulcer/appendicitis) Google brought me heregarding ironically, as it is causing me to be a nervous wreck.

Last month, I got hit with bronchitis hard. Couldn't breathe, chest was heavy, fever, hacking, the whole works. Around that time my stomach would be hurting after exercise or drinking a lot of wine or taking ibuprofen but I didn't think much of it, it always went away after awhile, and was t that bad. 
After the antibiotics, my chest was better, but my throat was still swollen. I ended up getting a raw piece  potato stuck in my throat (didn't chew it well enough) and had to get an endoscopy to push it down. Since then, I've had some of the worst acid reflux from my esaughagus being swollen, but nexium and tums seemed to help...until this morning. 

I drank a couple cups of coffee, to my multivitamin, and about and hour afterwards my stomach began hurting again. It felt like a knife stabbing me 1000 time in my upper abdomen. I planned on walking to the e.r., but I had to stop and rest at the police station, where they seen me sweating pofusely, breathing hard, and pale and called an ambulance. I'm there for three hours. My white cell count came back fine, as did my hemoglobin and everything else. She said before I left ""you may have an ulcer brewing down there but only your GI can go and look for sure"". I was released with a antacid and zophran.

Well like a dumbass, I sat down and Google my symptoms of an ulcer. Started reading about puforated abdomen and began freaking out . I tried to smoke some green to calm down, as it worked before, and had some vague pain in my lower right side. Since I am my own biggest asshole, I absent/stoner mindly put ""lower right abdomen pain"" thinking it was gonna say ulcer and reinforce what I believe without solid proof....aaaand guess what it says first? Appendicitis. I still have my appendix (not my galbladder), and boy, THAT was a dumb idea to google. I shut down my home screen and put in some gtaV and tried to veg out on that. It worked temporarly.

 I have to call my GI in the morning, and I keep telling myself I'm probably just tripping out and blood tests dont lie, but there's that though in the back of your head that keeps your heart racing. Mostly because I have never had appendicitis or an ulcer, no does anyone I know have had besides my dad, which I was 7 and remember my brother going when I was being a whiny as ""sexstarvedpeepingtom, dad has an ulcer. If it start's bleeding because your stressing him out he can die"". He did die, cancer 6 years later.

"Anxiety -&gt; ... -&gt; tender neck muscle To start, I've been going through a lot of health anxiety the last few months. I've never actually felt sick or anything, but this basically stems from getting fixated on swallowing/hyperawareness for months on end. 

It started out as if it might be tmj pain, but recently it was tongue pain, mostly when swallowing, for a few weeks. After I finally went to a dentist, assuming I must be scraping it on sharp teeth or something, they weren't able to find anything wrong. That has since eased off, I assume because my anxiety about it relaxed, but now it's more focused on a tender spot that seems to be on my scm muscle...which I saw can be a cause of swallowing pain.

The upper front end, just below the corner of my jaw, spanning about a half-inch. It feels as if it's bruised or something, and it seems to be super tender to the touch. I don't feel any strange lumps/lymph nodes, and my salivary gland above it feels fine, it seems to be part of the muscle or a tendon in there. Pretty close to the surface. I've read that trigger points in the digastric might be involved, causing ""pseudo-scm pain"" but it's been driving me crazy. I've also been feeling a lot of tension around the upper shoulders. 

So I wanted to just see if this all sounds like a reasonable idea of what's happening, and if anyone's got some advice. It's super irritating and it's really hard to take my mind off the tenderness. I'm going to try and get a massage next week I think. Any help would be much appreciated",1

"Anxiety over oral cancer A little over a week ago I noticed that I was having some pain in my mouth when eating so I looked to see that I have what looks like a bit of red bump/lump in the upper back corner.

"Hemorrhoids or Colon Cancer? Help? Help, freaking out a bit here.

Never considered the possibility of cancer.

Here's the symptoms:
- I'm young, 23, so I know I have the odds in my favor here as far as likelihood goes
- Itchy butt (it seems to start near my colon, but itches all the way up my crack and on my cheeks; this is why I initially thought it was a yeast infection); comes and goes depending on carb intake &amp; stress
- Just recently, I had some bad diarrhea and have been obnoxiously gassy since (for about the last week); farting is basically incessant
- Stools have normalized for the most part since, I'll have some hearty ones (the type you're proud of), sometimes some thinner ones, no additional diarrhea
- During the aforementioned diarrhea episode, there was some blood when I wiped (bright red, I seemed to come directly in contact with the ""source"" while wiping so not sure if that's a hemorrhoid or a polyp?); no blood in stool though
- Also, the itchy butt started after having sex w a girl I dated a few months ago (did an STD screening, negative)

What worries me is just the combo of the incessant gas + itchy burning butt + blood

Is a colonoscopy in order? Or does this sound like something less serious.

However, it came back with vengeance about two years ago in the form of relationship OCD. That faded and morphed into Contamination OCD. Itâ€™s been ruling my life for two years and Iâ€™m honestly sick and tired of it. I do everything in my power to keep myself and the things around me germ free. I know itâ€™s an irrational fear because 99% of people donâ€™t live like me and are doing just fine. I donâ€™t even know what Iâ€™m truly Afraid of. Getting sick doesnâ€™t really scare me (this part confuses me too, youâ€™re not alone). I just canâ€™t shake the anxiety I get when I know I have come in contact with germs... I am currently on Zoloft even though it doesnâ€™t seem to help. Any advise on how to kick this thing in the Ass would be greatly appreciated.. thank you ",1
"Colon Cancer Fears Creeping In again Hi.

So.. itâ€™s been a long time since I posted In here but today I had a bowel movement that was very dodgy. So my colon cancer fears have come back. Last year it sent me to the Dr. Multiple times. I donâ€™t have any other symptoms. No blood, no weight loss (if anything Iâ€™ve put a little on) no fatigue etc. - Just dodgy bowel movements. 1-2 times per day. 

Iâ€™m unsure as sometimes Iâ€™ll have these weird flat bowel movements then Iâ€™ll have normal ones. 

Just donâ€™t wanna be consumed by this fear again? ",1
"Fluttering Having an episode now and just need to vent. Open to advice or anything you have. A few months ago I started feeling a funny feeling in my chest. Specifically, it seems to occur when I lay down after light exertion. Like walking up the stairs and plopping on the couch. My heart flutters like crazy. It will beat hard one time, not beat for like two seconds, and then beat really fast. I get this funny feeling in the back of my throat, too. So, I went to my PCP and she listened and said she heard a murmur AND a flutter. Great. So, Iâ€™m dying. Well, she sends me to a cardiologist. I get an EKG and a halter monitor for 24 hours. Nothing shows. Cardio says itâ€™s fine. Not a single thing to worry about. But, I still get these things. It fucks with my head cuz I just keep thinking â€œa healthy heart doesnâ€™t do thisâ€ and â€œI will probably die young because of this.â€ I know these things are common, but that serves  little comfort when they are happening. I just worry that my heart is wearing out or something. Can anyone provide me with literature that goes into detail about how chronic palpitations are not associated with lower life expectancy? Or, if they are hit me with that shit too. Iâ€™m not afraid of the truth haha. I just get into this habit of checking my carotid pulse when it happens and being like â€œooohhh fuck youâ€™re surely gonna die this time... this is a bad one...â€ ",1
"Worried about tetanus. Today I was tearing apart an old wooden desk. There was one screw I was loosening and I reached out to pull the screw out when something pricked my pointing finger. 

I immediately pulled my pointing finger away and went straight to the bathroom to disinfect it with hydrogen peroxide. There was a small metal piece which had loosened from the screw and pricked me. The wound is no larger than a pinprick and it had no notable bleeding. 

Yet, here I am worried about tetanus.
Please educate me or assure me that I am going to be just fine - if you could. I am driving myself crazy.",1

"I've convinced myself I have oral cancer Maybe not the right place but I'm just anxious. I smoke once in a blue moon And I drink kinda regularly.

"Lymphoma fear Hey guys. I've been having a swollen lymph node ever since June and it's freaking me out. I had a full CBC in April and everything seemed perfect aside from a little high cholesterol.

After the tests everything started going haywire. In June I noticed the painless (sometimes it hurts) lymph node, started feeling tired (I've been building more muscle mass but my strength is getting lower), I started getting shortness of breath randomly (mostly when lying down), random itchiness non-localized and some pressure in my neck. My veins suddenly became very visible in my hands and feet (I think I'm pale but other people don't agree) and my tongue sometimes burns after eating and gets a bit swollen.

I'm really freaking out right now.",1
"Terrified of brain amoeba / fowleri Hi everyone. I'm down in South Australia, and I've found myself going a little insane over something very silly for the last day....

I will start by saying that our water has a decent amount of chlorine as far as I can tell, it's the only thing you can taste in the water, and if you fill a bathtub it's even ever so slightly green. There's never been an order to boil water or anything of the sort either here.

So moving onto story time. I often get itchy eyes before bed, so I keep a glass of water in the bathroom, that way I can rinse my eyes out quickly to calm things down, the glass of water had probably been out for a few hours, anywhere from 6- 12. Last night I did it, and as the water ran down my face a little bit got in my nose, maybe a drop or 2 tops. I started freaking a minute later as I remembered all I'd read about fowleri.... I blew my nose a bunch, and I rolled up some toilet paper, and stuck it up my nostril as well in an attempt to deal with any water that had made its way up there. I spent a terrified hour in bed reading things on my phone, and eventually calmed down enough to sleep.

Now all day today I haven't had a fever or anything of the sort, but I have been getting sinus headaches. (Quite possibly from blowing my nose so much) And I got rather paranoid in the shower too, anytime water got near my nose, or even the tiniest bit might have entered I freaked out a bit. My right nostril which is the one the water entered is also worse than the left, but the discomfort might just be from me freaking out and blowing it a ton... I have bad sinuses at the best of times, so it could just be dust or allergies too.

I know I'm probably being silly, but some confirmation would be lovely, especially since the glass of water, while cold was sitting out a long time... A day of sinus headaches just doesn't exactly fill me with confidence, even if it probably was cause I wouldn't leave things alone. One last thing to note is that 2 family members of mine recently had colds, so that might be why I'm feeling crappy sinus wise too, the right side being worse than the left still has me all freaked out though.",1
"A great, simple technique for coping with health anxiety (I posted this as a comment to another thread about panic attacks, but thought it warranted its own post. It's adapted for anxiety from a similar method in *Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy*, a book on depression by David D. Burns, M.D.)

***************

If you struggle with health anxiety (or any kind of anxiety really), give this a try the next time your worries start to get the better of you. I do it in an Excel spreadsheet, but a notebook works fine too.


**The Three-Column Technique**
 


**Column 1: Fear**
 
In this column, write down whatever's freaking you out at the moment: ""I'm worried I'll have a heart attack out of nowhere"" or ""What if someone took what I said at yesterday's meeting the wrong way?""

**Column 2: What triggered it**
 
Write down what you were thinking, feeling or doing when you started down your current worry spiral. For example, ""I felt a skipped heartbeat"" or ""I felt my lymph nodes and they seemed a little swollen."" Over time, some triggers will appear more often in your notes than others, helping you spot habits that get you into trouble.

**Column 3: Real talk**
 
Normally, you only think of the worst-case scenario. This is your chance to do the opposite: write down every reason you can think of that you'll be absolutely fine - which, by the way, are *exponentially more realistic scenarios*. Go nuts; the more you write, the better you'll feel. 

For example, my scariest symptoms are skipped heartbeats, so when I feel one, I list points like these:


 * Skipped heartbeats are perfectly normal; most people have them and don't even notice


 * Some people experience thousands of skipped beats a day and are perfectly healthy


 * You already met with a cardiologist, and she gave you a clean bill of health


 * Skipped beats are a very common side effect of anxiety - it's much more likely anxiety is the cause than some rare heart defect


 * This aside, I have zero symptoms of an underlying heart issue


  ...and on and on.

 
The more you use this technique, the more you'll notice the same fears and triggers popping up over and over again. And when you see that, you'll see how often you worry about the same thing - and how your worst fears are never, ever realized.

 
Hope this helps, stay strong!",1
"Thought I was finally getting over my brain tumour worry... It's been over two years, many ""illnesses"" (MS, Colon Cancer, Diabetes, you know the story) but the one constant is this damn brain tumour. Anti-depressants and CBT yet it's still there, I even successfully stopped googling anything medical for nearly 2 months but relapsed very bad this week. It always comes back to brain tumour, now I'm feeling like I haven't made any progress, I can't get past it. Don't know how much longer I can do this.",1
"As someone who has recovered from health anxiety, I want to reiterate how true the pinned post about reassurance is u/nathan98900 has posted some excellent advice about how reassurance feeds health anxiety. If you are not hypochondriac and you get stressed due to a chest pain, then yes, reassurance will work for you and you will get on with your life. But if you are hypochondriac, since your mind is in ""worry-mode,"" when you are reassured about one of your symptoms, yes you will feel temporary relief, but it is very likely you will probably find something new to worry about. I was sick and tired of worrying about every single symptom and spending a fortune on dozens of doctors. So one day I decided that I will stop caring about my symptoms and stopped googling and got on with my life no matter what. Then for a few weeks my symptoms and anxiety become worse, almost unbearable. Of course they would be. My anxious mind had got used to the instant gratification from reassuarance seeking and was begging for that. But I had said to myself that I would keep myself busy and distracted no matter how anxious I was and ignore my symptoms no matter how much panic I had. Then, something very logical happened. My mind decided that since I am not reacting to all these symptoms, then they must not be that serious. So it could take some time off and relax and not worry anymore. Then anxiety slowly dissipated and along with that all these symptoms that I thought could give me a diagnosis of 20 extra rare fatal diseases went away as well. 

Also remember that almost all people recover. You do not see that in this sub, because people that recover do not come back to post. You may feel hopeless now, but it is certain that you will be fine eventually once you find what works for you. This is what worked for me btw:

"Worried ive had cancer and its progressed too far now undiagnosed I apologize in advance for my sloppy writing. Im a 19 year old male, and 18 last year when i started experiencing my symptoms. It was June or july 2017 and i had been starting to feel tired more often as my senior year ended. Nothing shocking since ive always been tired and i was losing sleep over stress of not knowing where i was gonna go for college or how i was gonna spend the summer. One day in the summer when i was hanging out with my cousin i became unbareably tired and felt like i was gonna pass out. Id describe it just as the feeling of having really low blood sugar. I layed in my bed and freaked out because i thought i had something terribly wrong with me, my parents didnt take it seriously but instead talked very gently through it with me about how it was probably my anxiety and that did bring me back to feeling somewhat less fatigued after a rational conversation. I thought this feeling would go away during that week for sure, but i felt fatigued the whole week through. Being alone bored fatigued and scared to death that whole week took such a toll on my anxiety and stress levels. After that week i started to attempt to move past it, getting out and doing more physical things to try to shake it off and to also test that my physicallity wasnt degrading. Im not very fit and was never good at running but i wasnt physically diminished at all, i could run for just as long and do just as many pushups despite feeling a vague fatigue. After that it was on and off but it always came back, a sensation if vague fatigue and low blood pressure that would just strike me randomly. I went to the doctor a month later and all of my vitals were normal and he brushed it off as anxiety and stress related. I also wanted a blood test, which returned as completely normal. So i was just living like this, being constantly fatigued on and off. I eventually went back to him in august to try and get more answers but with good vitals yet again he wouldnt listen to my concerns and kept telling me it was psychological. I had another blood test which came back completely normal. Probably around september i started focusing on my bowel habits and noticed sometimes my food was indigested. So i thought hey, either colorectal cancer or ibs is behind this. I got a stool test done which came back completely normal. Now comes the beginning of this year and im still feeling frustrated by my off and on fatigue without any answers, so i try talking to a new gastro doctor because im still focused on having colorectal cancer. This doctor actually listens to everything i say and he suggests adding fiber to my diet. He asks me if i wanted a colonoscopy but i say no because im afraid to have one and we have poor insurance (which is possibly the most annoying aspect of this whole thing because whenever i visit the doctor which yields nothing my moms stuck with a bill that almost always goes into collections) anyway, i voice the concern that i might have celiacs disease because i have many food allergies as it is. I get a blood test done in late january checking for sprue and some cancer markers because i voiced my concern. Still completely normal and its not celiacs.  Here we are in march and my worries at an all time high. Its literally all i can think about. Made so much more troubling by the fact that over the past week ive been off balance on and off. (This started last week after smoking marijuana right after waking up and having an anxiety attack) im scheduled to go to a different doctor for a physical and guidance but the next available spot is fucking april 29th. Im so afraid i have some kind of abdominal cancer and its already too far. ",1
"I feel drained mentally because of myself Every single day for the past few years I have woken up and felt something wrong with me, and I convinced myself it was everything you could possibly imagine; cancer, AIDS, heart disease, and whatever else. I used to smoke cigarettes regularly (I switched to Juul which is still unhealthy but at least it's better), but I just recently quit due to my fear of developing cancer. Every tiny problem with my allergies/ constant dry cough/ dry throat/mouth has a reasonable cause, but I ignore it and continue to worry myself to death. My health anxiety is bringing me down, and I'm constantly depressing myself to the point of not caring about anything.

"Some advice for those of you suffering from hypochondria.... Get professional help before it turns into a more generalized anxiety. Over the course of six years I basically burned myself out on the health anxiety. One disease after another until the point that I stopped caring about any symptoms, imaginary or real, altogether. Unfortunately it's turned into a living hell of generalized daily anxiety with no breaks in between.

"Worried About Arsenic Poisoning I'm a college student volunteering at the local Natural History museum in the ornithology collection. Early on my supervisor warned me that some of the older specimens had been treated with Arsenic. I continued sorting specimens, never running into the aforementioned older ones until last Tuesday. When I encountered them I made sure to handle them carefully and thoroughly washed my hands when I had finished with each bird. When I mentioned the specimens to my supervisor she jokingly said ""technically we should be using gloves"". I immediately began to panic. For the last few days I've been concerned that my health has unecessarily been put in jeopardy. I read online that there can potentially be cross contamination between specimens, so now I'm worried other birds could have had trace amounts. I haven't always been super diligent about washing my hands post-volunteering. Now, I think I may have permanent brain damage. I forgot my headphones to an editing job today, which only bolstered my concern. Does anyone know anything about Arsenic? I'm freaking out.",1

"Phobia of appendicitis, anxiety whenever I get any tingling sensation in my stomach, i'm in a vicious circle Hello, i've been feeling pretty weird for about 15 days now, and I want to share a bit of backstory to help you understand better
6 or 7 years ago, I felt a huge discomfort around my abdominal belt, so much that almost had to sleep standing up because it was the most confortable position for me, I went to a doctor and he shoved his hand in my lower stomach so hard I screamed in pain, he said it was appendicitis even though the pain was coming from him and him only, and he rushed me to the hospital. After a day of stress they announce me that i'm fine and that I just have to take some medication because there was a problem with my nose for some reason.

Because of that experience, any small tingling sensation in my stomach puts me in a state of anxiety, my heart rushed, i feel heat around my head, I want to throw up and I have diarrhea, which are common symptoms for appendicitis, so i end up in a vicious circle.

I've been suffering from anxiety and depression for a while now, and i'm pretty inactive at the moment, I'm a lot on my computer but ever since too weeks i've been feeling stomach discomfort for sitting too long, which triggered my anxiety through the roof and messed up my digestive system, going from constipation to diarrhea every few days, I also suffer from lower back pain. 
After a night of drinking yesterday, I'm now left with anxiety and hangover, and an annoying discomfort in my right flank area, parallel to my arm under my ribs, which doesn't help my anxiety.

"Stressful, anxiety-ridden past few months So, I just wanted to start off by saying that this community has really helped me to calm down by knowing so many others are going through similar things as myself. Everyone is also so kind and helpful to one another, which is even more reassuring.

I've always had a little bit of health anxiety since I was a child (e.g. thinking I have appendicitis when I have a pain in my right lower stomach), but for the past several months, I have been in constant panic mode. It all started when I went to the ENT in December, she removed the wax from my ears (which I've had done before), and then a few days later I had intense ringing in my ears, a clogged feeling in my right ear, headaches, and dizziness. I was googling like crazy, which made things even worse. That ringing and googling led to, what I now know were panic attacks in which I was feeling disconnected from the world and having episodes of shaking, like the chills, amongst other symptoms. Long story short and countless ENT visits later where they didn't find anything wrong with me, I then went to the dentist who said I most likely had a TMJ disorder as a result of grinding my teeth, which I thought would make me feel better. But obviously, it didn't, and I just started to get different symptoms instead. 

I have been having a random ""tic"" in my neck in which it will randomly slightly jerk my head. Sometimes I get a little spazz in my leg or my arm as well, and a twitch that will last for a second or two in random body areas. I also have like a ""shaky"" feeling on the inside, which will sometimes lead to my fingers or toes being a little trembly. I recently have been getting floaters in my eyes, which I'm not sure if I've always had them and just never noticed, or if it's something new (my vision has been bad for years). Also, I randomly have ""visual snow,"" which I think I've also had for a while, but was never really concerned about until now. I feel like I am so hyper focused on my body and I just don't know how to get out of this phase.

I am only 23 and I feel like I am going crazy. I'm in my last year of grad school right now, and currently doing an internship in a hospital for speech pathology. So, not only am I at a super stressful time in my life, but I am around these disorders such as ALS, Parkinson's, MS, etc, and the fact that I see these disorders frequently, makes me even more nervous because they can really happen to anyone! I am caught between that ""1st year medical school"" syndrome thing and going to the doctor to see if there is something to actually be worried about. I stopped googling my symptoms, which has helped a great amount, but this anxiety has not fully gone away. 

For anyone taking the time to read this, thank you. It is a little bit of relief being able to express my feelings instead of keeping them inside.",1
"CT Scan coming up. I went to my primary a few weeks ago for what I suspected was a UTI. Turns out it wasn't and I was referred to a urologist. The doctor made me extremely nervous, said there was some trace blood in my urine and wants me to go in for a contrasting CT scan and then have a cystoscopy. I'm beyond to pieces right now. I haven't been able to focus at work or at home. I just keep thinking it's cancer even though there's no history in my family of bladder or kidney cancers and I'm only 29. It's all I can do not to google myself into a panic attack. The tests are still a week away does anyone have any advice or any stories of similar events that might help me get through the next week.",1
"So worried, any ideas what could be wrong? Hi everyone, so basically for the paat month i've woke up everyday with headaches, mostly tension headaches, and the feeling of pressure. I also get flashes of light in my vision, chills, and a tingly feeling going through my whole body, also pain in my arms and slight numbness in my fingers. 2 weeks ago i vomited aswell which really didn't help matters as i have a fear of vomiting.

Im convinced i have a brain tumor but i went to the doctor and he shone a light into my eyes and said everything looked ok but i still dont believe him. I've have headaches from anxiety on and off in the past but they never lasted this long before.

The last 2 months have been really stressful for me as my mum was in hospital with liver failure and i had to look after my dad during that time who is a schizophrenic. My anxiety was improving but this has brought me back down and i feel worse than ever.

Does anybody know what it could be? Is it a stress reaction or could i really have a brain tumor? ",1

"Possibly letting anxiety get to me? I am the type of poster that you will hate. I'm fully aware that I am 90% of the time just blowing everything out of the water with anxiety, it's been my MO for awhile.

I was at a bar talking to some women when we had to run my cousin back across the street to the hotel due to him getting into arguments. When we came back there were shots on the table for us and I really remember almost nothing after that. The only thing I remember is being in a car with one of the ladies and that guy being really grabby from the backseat.

Woke up at the lady's house the next morning and she dropped me off at my car. I've talked to her since and she's the guy did kiss me when we dropped him off. She said â€œyou did get out to piss at one point and he followed you out. Don't know what happened but you were only gone about 45 seconds and didn't say anything when you got back inâ€.

That was last Friday night/Saturday morning. It's not Sunday and I have been sick as fuck. Sore throat, head stuffed up, probably one of the worst coughs I've ever had. Obviously the first thing that comes to mind to me is HIV. As far as I've been told from her nothing happened that night aside from the kiss part. I have since noticed that the condom from my wallet is gone but that honestly could have been gone for awhile before hand. I may have just forgotten to replace it. I would think if anything else happened I would be a bit sore the next day. I obviously know nothing about this person so their status would be unknown to me.

I know the general consensus will likely be that I am being overly anxious. But I know that I will not be able to calm down until I can be tested. Apparently HIV RNA tests are able to detect after 11 days? The only thing I can find about those is through this site: https://www.stdcheck.com/hiv-rna-test.php

And I'm not sure how trustworthy that is. Thanks in advance!",1
Overreacting to symptoms Does anyone feels the same? If there is the slightest abnormality or pain on my body or state I get extremely anxious and am convined this is a sign of a serious illness. At night it's the worst and keeps me awake (like if there's a red spot on my skin it's probably skin cancer). I'm also too afraid to go to the doctor because he might find something terrible.,1
"Obsessing over stools. Worried about parasites. I've been looking at almost every stool I pass for the past couple of months because I'm crazy and I have a fear of parasites.

It seems to be only getting worse as now I'm afraid to eat some foods because of some stupid stories I read online. Yesterday I cut open a quinoa patty and almost had a panic attack because I didn't know quinoa looked like worms.

Anyway, back on the parasite topic. I've been passing weird white stuff for several months now and I think it's gotten more frequent somehow. Although I think it happens with every bowel movement.

I posted on /r/AskDocs with a pic if you're brave enough to go look at it (warning: it's pretty gross as you might have guessed).

I've also started washing my hands every time I touch something and I also check my bedsheets obsessively for anything suspect before I go to bed. I look at most foods with my phone's zoom, too.

I can't even pet my cats anymore because dandruff and flea eggs are like indistinguishable.

"Brain tumor anxiety Hey reddit. I'll start by saying that I'm a huge 22 year old hypochondriac. It started in last December, when I pooped a lot of blood and I was convinced that I've got colon cancer, I couldn't function properly for a whole month before I got my colonoscopy which revealed a small benign polyp which was removed.  
 
Anyways, since yesterday all I've been reading about is brain tumors. The reason of that is, when I was in work yesterday (slept only 6 hours and didn't have breakfast, then worked from 8 am to 2 pm) I kind of tripped twice when I was standing and wanted to turn around. Like, I'm clumsy overall and I sometimes trip or bump onto things, but never so often. Also, when handing the change to the customer (I'm a student but I work part time as a cashier) I dropped a coin twice. Or when he asked me for certain cigarretes, I grabbed the blue instead of red ones etc. After the day of overall lack of concentration I started googling and I found that brain tumor may cause clumsiness, loss of concentration, balance etc. I had a CT scan done 4 years ago due to head trauma but it was clear. However, I've read that tumors can grow fast. Should I go to doctor or observe myself for couple days? I've never head headaches as well. ",1
"My Health Anxiety Symptoms Hi Everyone! 

As someone who has been struggling with health anxiety for the last 4 years, I have found the acknowledgment of potential anxiety symptoms to be the most reassuring form of support. This is not only reassuring to me as it reminds me of all of the different ways anxiety might affect your body, it also reminds me (and hopefully others) that many of these symptoms quickly pass, as they are only manifested *only* as a result of mental illness. 

Here's all of the symptoms that have come and gone as a result of my health anxiety. I hope that people may relate, and be reassured. I've bolded those symptoms which have remained more constant throughout the last 4 years. 

1. tingling extremities 

2. **cold hands and feet**

3. muscle spasms (mostly in leg, thought it was a blood clot, it was not) 

4. **tightness of muscles** particularly around neck and shoulders 

5. dry mouth

6. **bruxism**

7. chest pain, stabbing 

8. **chest pain, dull/achey** 

9. constipation/diarrhea (thought this was hypothyroidism, it wasn't) 

10. hair loss (thought this was PCOS, it wasn't) 

11. Paralysis like symptoms (this came in two ways. One: overthinking things that should be unconscious-- me, thinking about swallowing, resulted in my temporary inability to swallow liquid. Two: mid panic attack, thought I could not move legs. 

12. **pelvic, vaginal/vulva pain** (thought this was vulvar cancer, literally got a chunk cut out of my vulva to test. As soon as results came back negative, the pain stopped)

13. **headaches**

14. **HEADACHES**

15. **pressure in head, tightness** 

16. insomnia 

17. **lethargy**

18. difficulty concentrating 

19. hearing phantom ringing (always hearing my alarm clock, even when it's not going off) 

20. jitters

That is all! (I think). I hope this helped someone, please feel free to ask any questions. ",1
"Not sure what is real and whatâ€™s not anymore Hey guys,

I am a 29 year old female with two kids ages 6 and 11, I have had this illness since I was around 6. It would be to the point I would make myself hyperventilate and my heart would go nuts and go to the emergency room, I would vomit all the time and be in serious pain. I had all sorts of tests and they were all negative. It died down a lot from ages 13-24 but since then itâ€™s been getting worse. It didnâ€™t help that for 3 weeks in 2016 I thought my symptoms of a bad headache, neck pain and double vision was just my anxiety but it turned out to actually be meningitis!!! I was in the hospital for 7 days. 

Now, every headache I freak out. Every rash I freak out. Stomach ache, palpitation, everything. Iâ€™ll be at the store sitting in front of the bp machine for 10 minutes. I carry around a thermometer if I feel hot I check my temperature. I google non stop. I look in the mirror and smile to make sure Iâ€™m not having a stroke. Itâ€™s embarrassing and terrible!

Lately I have been losing my memory and getting panic attacks when the light changes from high to low. I have a red rash on my face I canâ€™t get rid of. And I KNOW these arenâ€™t made up. A least not my memory or rash. I go to an mri Wednesday to see if something actually is wrong. Please wish me luck as Iâ€™m already nervous enough!",1
"Stomach ulcer concerns Been anxious for a while about this. I fear I have a stomach ulcer.

To keep things, I will have random spasms across the abdomen with a sense of feeling hungry at night. Sometimes dull pain will be there and I belch often enough. I can get gassy but it is not prominent.

It isnt a burning pain and it doesnt interrupt my sleep. I will feel nauseous after eating at times but not always.

Stools are fairly normal. Light brown that sinks.

No vomitting as of yet. Fatigue nothing out of the ordinary. I will feel some sort of ache on the breastbones, arms and knees but the latter two not every day.

I will have lower back pain - but only at my job that requires a lot of standing and easily relieved with exercise. I do not have back pain at home or when moving. Only by standing at work 

Am I being a nervous Nick or os there genuine concern to be had?

"My neck hurts. Is it serious? I have two swollen lymph nodes, pea sized, on ONE side of my neck only. Iâ€™ve been fighting a cold, so my sister says itâ€™s nothing to worry about. 
However, our other sister died of lymphoma at age 33. 
Iâ€™m supposed to leave for vacation Monday, so itâ€™s unlikely Iâ€™ll go to the doctor before then, also, no health insurance yay USA.

"Feeling stupid lately... Alright so Iâ€™m 16m, have health related anxiety, and have had this sort of thing before.  Maybe someone has something wise to say.

So I constantly worry about losing intelligence; Iâ€™m a pretty bright guy but I often worry that this attribute is slipping away from me.  Iâ€™m rather insecure about this.

I work at a swimming pool thatâ€™s under construction.  There were diesel fumes in the pool the whole 3 hour shift.  They were bad enough at one point to give a coworker a headache, and at least one patron turned right around when she came in and smelled how and it was.  Mgmt didnâ€™t close till the last 30 mins!  I was one of the last on the deck.  Didnâ€™t really get a headache, though.  Anyway I own a juul, I was using that before and after.  So nicotine exposure.  Havenâ€™t used it for a few days.  Also I drank a bit with friends the night of that work shift.  Continued using the juul and drank more the night of the next day.  Also I was at higher altitude for two days after this, but only 2000 ft higher than the 5000 of my hometown.  Back home and still feel what Iâ€™m about to describe.  

I feel like my memory has been shitty since this, and my mental/cognitive/linguistic abilities down.  I feel dull.  Iâ€™ve had scares like this before, but this feels different.  Is this just anxiety? Anxiety seems to cause very real physical symptoms for me, but I feel less stressed than I normally would during this type of episode.  Anyone have any words of advice?  

EDIT: Forgot a MAJOR component: I got a meningitis vaccine the day before the second drinking incident.  Not an antivaxer at all, I just was worried about the interactions between all these in relation to my memory/mental issues recently.  Kinda reinforces my point that I forgot this big part which was a primary part of my thoughts about this :(",1
"Real problem , but i'll post here for looking some help. Hello, so i'm a 27 year guy - one kidney. 

I decide to post my problem on internet because i need a solution or a real explanation of my problem. 


2 years ago i made a CT contrast Scan for a neck problem, and after this episode i had start to urinate a lot of foam and smelly urine everytime (yes , the next day after CT scan) 2 doctor told me that ""there was no protein so just don't look at your pee anymore"" .

"Paranoid I'm having a stroke, heart attack, blood clot or Diabetes... Help please v.v So for the past week I've been having issues with my neck, on the left side. Feelings of fullness, I would constantly feel it seeing if there were any bulging veins or something, and it would go down to my should or back. I think I pulled a muscle. So I went to an urgent care the other day and the doctor told me there's nothing wrong, says I just pulled a muscle. 

On top of that, suddenly today I've been getting tingling and numbness on my left arm and hand/fingers.

I was streaming a game and I noticed my left hand started shaking and twitching, and my right is perfectly fine. So after ending my stream, I went into the bathroom to check it more and it's been really scaring because my brain thinks I'm having a stroke... 

ON top of that with that shaking and tingling in my left hand, my left side of my jaw and cheek are also tingly, and it's still happening as I write this post... 

So recap.. my symptoms are... 

- Tingling and Slight Numbness in Left Hand/Fingers
- Shaking in Left Hand
- Twitching thumb
- Tingling / Slight numbness in my left cheek and jaw

"Hantavirus - freaking out - vacuumed large amount of what looked like mouse droppings from engine bay of car. Iâ€™m seriously worried right now. Hereâ€™s my info. 

Male 
21 yrs old
165 lbs
5â€™11â€
No previous health issues and no medications

I purchased an older vehicle from Alabama (I live in northern Illinois) on March 3rd, 2018. It was shipped that day and arrived March 6th, 2018. On March 25th, 2018 I opened up the engine cover (It is a van) and discovered a large amount of broken nuts or acorns and what looked like mouse droppings (small, round pellets about the size of rice) on top of the engine, along with a few chewed wires. Iâ€™m assuming that at some point this van sat for a period of time (not sure if recently before purchase, but I assume not, as there are was no sign of a current infestation to the previous owner prior to purchase). Anyway, fast forward to me cleaning it out a few days ago with a regular household vacuum. I donâ€™t believe I used a respirator (mask) for all of the time, but if I did it was a 3$ one that is made for basic things like sanding, not for chemicals or pathogens. I vacuumed it up for quite awhile, probably about an hr. My question is, am I at risk for hantavirus? It seems that the virus wouldnâ€™t survive after excretion for very long, and assuming that the mice were active until the very day that the van was picked up in Alabama (unlikely), there still wouldâ€™ve been about 2.5 weeks between then and when I first opened up the engine compartment, and another week or so until I vacuumed it up. Any knowledge or experience with this? Lifespan of hantavirus after excretion? Iâ€™m killing my self over this and my anxiety is giving me a bunch of â€œsymptomsâ€. Thank you in advance! ",1
"Throat nastiness for months! Honestly just need a little reassurance that nothing is wrong. I'm a 22 year old male, and I've had hard swollen lymph nodes in my neck (especially my right side), drainage and nasty looking tonsils for 2 months. I've also had a feeling of tightness in my throat. I've been on allergy medication but it hasn't really helped. 

2 blood tests have shown that I have low white blood cell count, and I have had a round of antibiotics but it didn't help. I've seen 2 nurse practitioners and the only thing they could offer is that I do an STI test, which came back all clear. I'm going to see my PCP soon, but as a college student 5 hours away from home, it makes me a bit anxious that something could be seriously wrong and I'm so far away from decent help, or at least help that my insurance covers. Plus, I've already missed at least 3 days of school for visits and whatnot. 

Just a sinus infection that is lasting for months? Some other virus? Some STI the test didn't check for? Something worse? I have no idea. If anybody is interested in seeing a picture of my throat, it's in another post in my post history. ",1
"I'm so tired. I am 27 y.o, male, and I am so fucking tired. Every goddamn day that I wake up I have a brief moment of calm before everything gets going. 
When I wake up, I am fine. 2 hours later I know that I am going to die in a couple of weeks. It never ever fucking goes away. 
Being a hypochondriac, is going to either kill me from some fucking disease or it's going to make me kill myself. I have
tried getting help from the psychiatric ward, and I was actually seeing a therapist for a couple of weeks before they said 
that before we can go on I have to start taking my ADHD medication again. I said ""Ok fine"" thinking that it would only be a couple
of weeks before I could continue with the therapy sessions. It has now been over 3 months since I was in a session. It always keeps on getting
postponed because a doctor quit or that ""there are many people waiting for a psychiatrist"". I am so fucking tired of waiting, so fucking tired of 
worrying about disease X and disease Y. 
The first time I started experiencing problems was this autumn. I went abroad and as soon as I landed I got a lot of problems with my stomach. 
Constipation, dihareea. When I got back home I went to see a doctor who did a shit load of tests on me. Couldn't find a single problem with me
other than possible lactose intolerance. So I went to another doctor who said it was most likely IBS. After a couple of weeks the problems went
away, until I was more or less completely normal. Then I noticed I started loosing weight. My thoughts automatically went to a number of horrible 
diseases. I started eating more, and stopped taking my daily walks. (Which I started because I was told it was good for anxiety). 
When my dad came to visit the latest batch of problems started showing up. A lump in the throat. It feels like I have something
stuck in my throat that I am trying to swallow all of the time. It's not present the first couple of hours after I wake up, but after a while
it sets in. So I went to the doctor today and described my issue, and after an examination including blood tests and some stick in the throat
tests, he said that he could not see anything. He mentioned ""Globus"", and I have read that that is connected with anxiety. I just can't seem
to get it into my head that it is that and not something else. This is where I am at the moment.
I am so tired of this constant worry all of the time, and I am so tired of going to the doctor every other week trying to figure out 
if I am going to die next month or not. It is so fucking exhausting...
The only medicine I have at the moment is Promethazine for my anxiety, and I don't really know if it is helping or not. I guess it helps a little, 
but only for a couple of hours. 
I am tired of this, and thoughts of just ending it and getting it over with are constantly lurking around. What the fuck am I going to do?",1
"Change in stool? First post here! 

I know it's gross, but I've noticed what I would call a significant change in my stool within maybe the last year. I don't go nearly as often, and sometimes when I do, it feels like it's very little or there's more in my body that I can't get out. I think that's kind of normal, since I'm a 24-year-old female and I know my metabolism has to slow down at some point, but I feel uncertain about it. 

On top of that, I have noticed a little bit of blood in my stool. I've have had trouble with hemorrhoids in the past, so I'm pretty positive that's got to be what the blood is coming from. 

On top of THAT, I've also noticed an increasing amount of mucus in my stool, which I feel like my body may be producing to make up for my possible constipation. 

Anyway, it worries me because I know colon cancer is becoming more prevalent in adults my age. In addition, I'm not overweight, but I have a history of eating poorly, which I know can lead to colon cancer.

I'm definitely going to pass this information along to my physician the next time I see her, I guess I just wanted to see what someone might say here first. ",1

"Be careful of Google results. Don't click on calmclinic. Also my head hurts. I'd never seen the website before in my life, but it was suddenly not only the promoted result *and* the top non-promoted result when I googled a generic symptoms (I know, googling bad). I clicked out of curiosity, seemed like an innocuous anxiety website, it directed me to a test, which then offered to send me in-depth results via email (no), or I could get basic results, which I clicked. Then a long-ass video with a woman promising she could cure me in just a few weeks, no meds, no therapy! It was really deceptive because the video suggested she would tell you the solution at any moment, but eventually she asked for $78. It was an obvious scam (to me) and I knew that from the start, but it was really well crafted. I doubt anyone here would fall for that sort of thing, but if you see calm clinic in Google results, click on the feedback button to report it as a scam. :) I think at one point the woman insinuated that if you thought the whole deal was too good to be true, that also was your anxiety lol.

"worried sick about vCJD 19/F. USA, California

I feel like I fucked up so bad. Like yeah, hamburgers are arguably gross, but I always thought they were just bad for you nutritionally and that was a lot easier to dismiss than ""hey your burger might be harboring a death sentence"". I didn't learn about BSE/vCJD until a few months ago. I feel disgusting. The only beef I really ever ate was ground beef, whether it's from the store or from taco bell or some other burger joint. I ate ground beef frequently and carelessly. 

I have tiny muscle twitches frequently at night and it perpetuates my fear. What do you think the odds are that the beef I ate contained BSE? I'm reading that fast food ground beef uses the mechanically repurposed beef which is basically all the risk tissue smashed into a patty. I'm horrified and terrified. I have panic attacks nightly.

"Relapse Advice Hello, Fellow Hypochondriacs! 

I've had severe health anxiety for a couple of months beginning around August last year. Panic attacks, pulse checking, spending way too much at the doctor's office, the whole shebang. 

Around February, I got on top of my shit and turned a leaf. My therapy, healthy eating, and exercise finally kicked in and I was literally like a new person. The health anxiety dissipated and I was able to function. 

But, after a dizzy spell over easter and a whole bunch of stomach problems from eating too many things I'm intolerant to, I've had a major relapse. I'm back to not sleeping, I can feel my heartbeat constantly, I'm Googling non-existent symptoms and struggling to function again. I'm hoping this is just a temporary relapse, a speed hump in what has otherwise been a pretty linear recovery.

"Should I wait for my appointment on Monday or go now? I keep freaking myself out... Im not seeking any medical advice I just want to know if this type of thing can wait a couple days or if itâ€™s an emergency.

So I have pretty bad depression and it makes me lose motivation to take care of my health.  Despite that i have health anxiety and always thing Iâ€™m gonna die lol. 

Well I went to the dentist recently and we scheduled a day to do some fillings and I have one tooth that needs to be extracted but was waiting for a later date. My fillings appointment is on Monday. Just my luck, either the tooth that needs to be extracted or the tooth that needed a filling next to it got infected just yesterday. I had bad jaw pain and tooth pain and my face is swelling. Iâ€™m taking some over the counter meds and trying to tell myself I can wait this out until my appointment on Monday. Iâ€™m not in any pain anymore but my face is swollen still.

Anyway I know a tooth infection left untreated can get worse and start breaking down your jaw and infect your heart and whatnot and the thought of that is really freaking me out. Iâ€™m afraid if I wait half a week to go to my dentist it will land me in the hospital. I just need someone to tell me Iâ€™ll be okay and waiting till Monday isnâ€™t long of a wait. Ugh...",1
"Working out worsening my anxiety Hey all,

I'll try to make my story as quick as possible. I've been working out for about 9 year now. I've battled forms of anxiety and depression my whole life. My health anxiety has been at an all time worst this past month. About a month and a half ago I took performance enhancing drugs (PEDS). I stopped cold turkey after taking them for 12 days cause I saw some symptoms I didn't like. Ever since I've stopped, my panics and anxiety have been killing me. My biggest fear is that I screwed up my heart just from those 12 days. 

I don't really fear anything else except for heart issues. I haven't been able to sleep since I've been in fear. I went to my doctor and she gave me all the physical tests (took my blood pressure, listened to my heart/breathing and checked my limbs for swelling) and she said everything seemed fine.

Yesterday I returned to the gym and working out makes me so nervous. I keep thinking any type of physical exertion is gonna cause my heart to stop. One symptom I've noticed is that I feel a weird bubbly feeling stemming from my upper left abdomen, sort of where my chest meets my stomach and it feels like a weird pressure/bubble rising through my stomach/chest and throat on the left side. It's almost like I have to burp but can't. I noticed its been happening and its mostly when I workout. I'm super scared that I have AFib. Hoping this is just anxiety related or stomach related. 

I've been doing so much googling lately that I've come up with about 50 different possibilities of what it could be lol.",1
"do you ever just went on r/lastimages late at night. saw â€œpulmonary edemaâ€ and googled it. connected some of my own â€œsymptomsâ€ to symptoms of that illness.

also, â€œdoes anyone know how painful it is and how easy it is to tell if you have pulmonary edema? How fast do the symptoms worsen, when does it become fatal?â€ just a ton of questions you want to know the answer for that arenâ€™t on the websites so you can reassure yourself. ugh",0

"17, Need professional help but not sure if parents understand that I'm 17 and male. Since last year I've constantly thought im going to have a heart attack, cardiophobia. It's really starting to get in the way. 
  
It started with bad heart palpitations and arm pain and I took multiple trips to the urgent care center and a few ekgs, and they all said I was fine. It takes me so long to fall asleep at night because of this, I get anxiety attacks often, and I've formed a habit where I need to knock on wood almost all the time to calm me down a bit (weird habit)  
  
I'm not overweight and I go for bike rides a lot but my dad is always telling me to workout because he loves working out. I tried it months ago but the fear I was going to have one multiplied and I couldn't stand feeling my heart beat. He's trying to have me do guided meditation but for some reason that makes me way more anxious than when I started. He hasn't wanted me to go to therapy because I haven't ""committed to his solutions yet"".   
I get and appreciate he's trying to help but I really wanted professional help. I went to them in tears a couple weeks ago saying please just let me get some professional help, and my mom said she'd find someone. Fast forward to today and I found out she got my a family psychologist, one that already sees my 10 year old brother (he gets very angry).   
I wanted an actual therapist, I'm not sure if it's the same thing and my mom is saying that ""he's just going to say the same things we've been saying and it's going to cost a lot""  
I'm not trying to make my parents look bad because I get they're trying to help, and my mom used to have a lot of problems with depression and anxiety when she was a teen so I'm sure she gets it, but I just dont know what the fuck I'm supposed to do anymore. Looking for any advice. I usually take my mind off it by hanging out with my friends by the campfire at night and that sort of stuff but I moved from New England to TX 3 months ago and I haven't made any close friends yet.  
I just need some advice, this stresses me out so bad every day thinking I'm going to die, please and thank you so much.",1
"Swelling under ""Xiphoid process"", results in mental issues and gastrointestinal tract issues Hello,

I am 27 years old male. I am a lonely guy that drinks a lot of beer. I drink only beer intentionally, so that the harm of alcohol is less. 


Recently, however this is still becoming an issue. I let my alcohol addiction to beer to overrule my healthy life. I smoke a lot of cigarrettes and I drink beer every day. I also drink so much coffee. My life is good, but recently I feel this anxiety. My overall performance is getting lower too.


A few months ago I noticed that I have swelling exactly bellow my ""Xiphoid process"". It is something internal. I have Gastrointestinal tract issues. I feel stomache discomfort, as well as drifting issues regularly. I researched about symptoms and could not get any information about it...

Recently I feel a lot of anxiety and it is messing my decisions and mental health already. I think this could turn into dementia or something serious. It could be a cancer, as well, I don't know.


I could have possibly gone to a doctor, but the problem is that I come from a poor family and owe around 500 euro for health care, which I cannot spend at this point. 

I hope you guys could help me identify the possible reasons for all this, so I can make some adequate response to it.. And I will see a doctor soon probably. I am just a bit scared and unaware of what I did to myself. 


Hope you guys support me and give me advice, Thanks!

**EDIT;** Also, I have been very anxcious around people ever since child. Every time I talk to someone, I feel something like pain in my stomache and have to make effort for all my conversation. I ended up a quiet and lonely guy because of it. This is the whole reason I abuse alcohol, cigarrettes and coffee. I wanted to overcome something psychological to be more connected. This abuse was obviously affecting my digestive system or something.. i don't know. I know that this will become a nightmare and could possibly be the reason for my death some day.

**Edit:** sorry, I am actually 30 years old male. I am so embarrased right now. 

**TLDR:** Swelling under ""Xiphoid process"", anxiety, mental disorder due to beer abuse and smoking

"Please help, i'm mentally breaking down slowly. Am I going insane? I dont know why but I keep worrying about having a hormone issues, I have some symptoms of low testosterone, low ring finger (I dont see any men I ever met ever having a short ring finger), puffy nipples that developed over time. I'm docile and weak and I'm isolated 24/7. I keep telling my mom of the symptoms I have and we went to a doctor before and I just told them to test my testosterone around 2 pm and they said it was normal! 

I later realized I had gyno but not enough to be noticeable at all (I juts have puffy nipples) but she wont take me to the doctor again to ask him about it.

"Sick of taking anxiety medication ast year I was paralyzed on my left side due to a lesion on my brainstem. I recovered thankfully and learned to walk, talk and eat again. I have documented the last 15 months since being discharged. I have tried different medications (a lot) for my residual symptoms. Equilibrium and gait issues, depression and anxiety, cognitive issues and most importantly my severe neuropathy. If I didnâ€™t take my medicine I was so itchy and uncomfortable I would be clawing at my feet and legs and actually leaving pretty big cuts. I was losing my train of thought and having trouble finding certain words. I have been in the medical neurology field since I was 19, Iâ€™m 34 now. I know about medical issues and treatments and all of them have such a negative impact on daily life. I had to make a change. I started taking CBD oil and weaned myself off all my meds. I feel great. My thinking has improved. My speaking skills are on point now. I am no longer losing bits and pieces of a conversation. I wish I did this sooner. Like I said I recovered, but I was left with a lot of symptoms, things that my grandparents are complaining of and even though Iâ€™m only 34 this is my life now. I canâ€™t go on the rest of my life taking pills everyday. So now I take CBD oil in the morning and at night. I started out slowly and gradually increased it. I decided to start selling it to get a discount on my monthly oils. Im not a sales person but if I can benefit from this, I am sure other people in the same boat as me could too. I was desperate and willing to try anything and now knowing I can take something that is all natural and not made by a pharmaceutical company and itâ€™s legal makes me feel so good. I donâ€™t mind talking to you personally or just go to the website. http://www.hempworx.com/DfrizadoI I wish you luck on finding your cure to be pain free, now that Iâ€™ve tried this I am not going back to pharmaceuticals.

"Diarrhea...every single night! So in the past couple of years, Iâ€™ve shit the bed while sleeping, three times...after the second time, I figured out Iâ€™d had a stomach ache prior to going to bed. So then I started taking Imodium anytime I had the slightest stomach ache before bed. Itâ€™s gotten to be less and less effective at stopping it, and even had a breakthrough accident recently, even after taking ten or 12 pills before bed! I take a LOT of sleep meds due to severe insomnia, so when I wake up from it, I can barely shower and change sheets without a dangerous fall.

"Struggling to discern between anxiety and ""real"" symptoms How does anyone manage to deal with health anxiety, when you clearly have symptoms of something and it isn't just a general worry about dropping dead from cancer or a stroke? 

A couple of weeks ago I noticed I had ""air hunger"", that sensation that you aren't getting enough oxygen and I have begun to get vertigo / dizzy or lightheadedness quite frequently. Here in the UK it is quite hard to get a Dr's appointment that isn't an emergency one and I have got one booked in for close to the end of the month. The last week has been horrible for me, because while realistically as a 29 year old I am not at a huge risk of lung cancer or heart failure and I cannot stop obsessing about how serious this illness could potentially be. Especially because it is clearly not a common cold, but if it is real maybe a viral infection like labyrinthitis. The problem is that the more I worry, the more things happen like palpitations, stomach ache and such like. All classic anxiety symptoms that I am sure are due to my HA, but my mind just cannot reconcile that the simplest explanation must be true. Its the opposite of how i operate as I am a scientist and normally think very logically. 

In the past I have spoken to the GP about my HA, but they don't really seem to do much about it. I asked if I could be refereed to someone, but instead was told to look up self-help related stuff online. Weirdly, I worry that being labelled as a hypochondriac on my medical records will bias a doctor towards me if I am require treatment. 

Just have no idea how I am going to get through the next few weeks until I can see a GP for a 10 minute ""lets do nothing and see what happens"" waste of time. ",1

After that, I went straight home to rest . I did not think of any disease or symptoms , I thought that happened because I was away from sport for a long time ,A week later I started paying attention to every detail, and these are the symptoms that I have:
Diarrhea. Blood in stool. heart palpitations . I think I lost weight too. Exhaustion. Vomiting. After Googling these symptoms it turns out to be Colon cancer . I'm so scared right now . I've never been this worried before and  I can't visit the doctor until next week , anything would help .",1

"Today I had THE worst panic attack of my life Ok, so just got home from hospital, after having a major panic attack.
My HA started 6 years ago, when I fell ill, had a number of tests on my head and heart over the course of a few weeks. During this time, I convinced myself I was dying - too many different ailments to list.
I started having panic attacks, usually when in a crowded area, that were debilitating.
Cue lots of therapy, medication and 6 years later, I felt I had it under control (I still have bad days and symptoms, but not as bad as previous). I haven't had a proper panic attack for a couple of years.
Then today. I've had a cold for a few days, and had taken my daughters to their dancing competition, when suddenly I started to feel dizzy. This quickly became a cold rush through my body and tunnel vision. Heart rate doubled, blood pressure rose, and I was expecting to pass out.
I have friends at this competition, and I asked them to call an ambulance. Trip to a&amp;e, 2 ecg's later and given the all clear, I'm now resting at home, heart rate slowly coming down, and the cold rushes are getting further apart, and I'm mentally drained.

"Pressure on head likely due to stress and anxiety, but knowing this doesn't make it go away. Hey everybody, 

20 yo Male here.

To give a little rundown for the past year or so whenever I have any sort of problem with my body I tend to assume the worst and can't stop thinking about the issue until I get 100% confirmed of the problem and that it is solvable. A good representation of this was in December I thought I was having heart palpitations, and it really stressed me out. Long story short and a few doctors visits later, I had an ultrasound of my heart, and I passed with flying colors, where there were no signs of any problem with my heart. After that day, my heart did not flutter once and hasn't really since because if I ever start to get to that point, I remember the ultrasound and how good it was, and the problem will cease. 

More recently however, my lower right abdominal was hurting and after some googling (which I know is bad for me but I still do anyway) I believed it could be appendicitis. So I did my classic worrying and got some bloodwork done and a CT scan, and there was classically no issue to worry about. A few days later with some medication, the gut problems went away, but then I had my first nosebleed in a few years. I live in upstate New York, so this should not be an uncommon thing, but it spiraled into something very aggravating.

This is where we address my current issue, which is a pressure on my head that is likely some sort of tension headache. The pain level in my head is extremely low, probably around a 1, but I can tell all the muscles in my neck/shoulders are now tense. I have been doing my classic Googling, and I'm certain that all these symptoms I have been getting are solely due to anxiety and stress, but knowing that isn't taking away any of the tension in my head. This problem has caused me to have trouble falling asleep, making me wake up in the middle of the night, and waking up much earlier than I would want to. Last night it felt as though I just laid there and didn't sleep at all, but I'm sure I likely did. I am now on a more or less sleep schedule of trying to go to bed around 1 am, not being able to until 2:30 am, then rising for morning at about 7:30 am. This whole process is likely what is causing my stress, but is also something that is tough to conquer due to my stress. I have started to work out recently, and usually after hitting the gym I am feeling ""normal"" for a little while, but right when I wake up my symptoms manifest and it's back to this anxious version of myself.

I am not sure what I am hoping to come of writing this, maybe I just want someone to tell me that what is happening is solely due to my stress/anxiety so I can affirm that even further. Or, maybe I want somebody to reciprocate with me and tell me they went through the same thing, and let me know how they got through it. Right now it just seems like a constant cycle that is very tough to break, but I'm hopeful for the future.

Hope everyone has a great day, and thanks for any help.",1
"Hydroxyzine for Anxiety After having anxiety for most of my life, I had my first panic attack last night.

"Heart Disease, depression, anxiety, and stress This semester I am taking Abnormal Psychology. One of the chapters I had the misfortune of reading was on the physical health effects of negative emotions, something I am chocked full of. Whether its stress, anxiety, depression, anger/frustration, I show it. My mood bounces around a lot. 

Even at my young age of 23 I am starting to worry about developing heart disease, something my neurotic nature seems to be a predictor of. Most of my life I've eaten a poor diet (although my cholesterol was only 150, with my LDL at 88 and my HDL at 30. No idea about cortisol, CRP, or interlukins though). 

I have also been pretty sedentary (though that is very slowly starting to change) since I turned 18 and have had a slew of medical problems since then. My gums have receded more (I fought off gingivitis but am on the cusp of developing gum disease from gum recession). I used to get very angry at video games, I developed tinnitus a year ago which drives me crazy, and I'm depressed and socially isolated. 

I have no know history of heart disease, but of depression and low serotonin. Thus I am stuck in a dilemma. I also started taking amphetamine mediation for ADHD in January, so my heart rate tends to be higher on average but I eat less and have lost weight. In some cases, my blood pressure is normal on stimulants even when it feels elevated. I'm paranoid about my health, a bit of hypochondriac. I vape, don't drink anymore, and and am an on and off smoker. 

All of these things and more point to heart disease. I cannot just relax however, and I refuse to take antidepressants. I detest those medications and will take any medicine for depression that is not an antidepressant or antipsychotic. Even at the cost of my life from getting heart disease, I will risk low mood, higher inflammation, and more clotting and an early death than take those. 

I have often been pointed to exercise as the key, which I will do in the form of jogging. I will not do yoga, even if its ""relaxing"" because I think its a stupid form of a exercise. I want a form of exercise where I can feel angry and aggressive. Maybe that defeats the point but at least its something. 

I need some answers within my confines. Diet changes are hard because I'm a picky eater and will throw up if something doesn't taste good. Regular, good sleep is also out of the question because, for some reason, I rarely sleep more than 4-5 hours consecutively. Exercise is pretty easy, I'm just a bit lazy. 

I'm open to ideas but antidepressants are absolutely out of the questions. ",1

"Started with Ectopic beats; now I feel like Iâ€™m having heart attacks! In January, I had started having â€œfunnyâ€ heart beats. The. One day I was sitting in class and a felt warm all over and then my heart started to race and then I broke out in a cold sweat. I went to the ER and got a ekg(normal), heart attack blood marker test(normal), and a chest xray(normal). While I was there I found out the â€œfunnyâ€ heartbeats were ectopic beats.

My primary care sent me for hotter monitor(confirmed benign ectopic beats), stress test(normal), and echocardiogram(normal). This still wasnâ€™t good enough for me so I asked to have a CT angiogram to make sure I had no blockages. This came back clear.

I had a couple good weeks and was getting good at ignoring my â€œfunnyâ€ heart beats and then just days ago I started to focus on odd feelings in my left chest almost under my armpit. No sweat, shortness of breath or any other symptoms. So I went to the Emergency room and of course everything normal.

No matter how many times I tell my self to calm down everything is alright. It just does not work and I just focus more and more. Itâ€™s really getting to me ðŸ˜©",1
"Anxiety, panic and my heart I donâ€™t really get it, I mean I do but, I donâ€™t at the same time. Like today, I just had a really bad panic attack all because I went for a walk. Iâ€™m 26 and quit smoking about a month ago now. I know nothing is wrong with me, except that I used to smoke and am struggling with things like shortness of breath etc. but, every time I get my heart rate up even a little or feel short of breath my anxiety kicks in then quickly turns into a panic attack. I get ALL the usual symptoms, tight chest/chest pain, light headed, fast heart rate, and those agitating urges to hit the toilet among other things. 

Iâ€™m afraid of having a heart attack and constantly monitor my heart. Itâ€™s debilitating because I donâ€™t want to go for once enjoyed walks, a run or even work...nothing that would increase my heart rate even a little. I really do hate it and I just want to get over it but, the slightest internal change just sets off my panic. 

Iâ€™ve been to several doctors, though not since I stopped smoking, and everything has always come out fine. No heart problems on ekgs, ultra sounds or X-rays etc. No major problems in the slightest. 

My mom thinks Iâ€™m insane. She used to have panic from excessive worrying but, never health related anxiety. Sheâ€™ll confront me about it sometimes and I think itâ€™s just so she can tell me how crazy I am anymore. As soon as I try to explain my fear she rolls her eyes, waves her hand and walks off with some ridiculous verbal response. I wonder how sheâ€™d feel if people did that to her years ago with her excessive worrying. Iâ€™ve told her to stop talking to me about it if sheâ€™s going to be that way but, it hasnâ€™t deterred her. 

She tells me sheâ€™s been right where I am but, got over it and treats me like an inferior because the magic trick she used doesnâ€™t just work for me like it did her. I call it magic because it was like she was all better over night. ",1
"Anxiety/Antsy 2 weeks Post-Op Septoplasty/Turbinate Reduction - Need Support Hi all! 

First time poser here. I am a healthy 28 y/o Male who recently just had a Septoplasty/Turbinate reduction 15 days ago. I am a very active guy and usually very ""chill"" and outgoing. 

For those of you who don't know what that is, it's for a deviated septum and you have splints up your nose for a week with a ton of congestion and basically can't do anything while recovering but sit at home (I live by myself with family close by). 

Due to the surgery, I was instructed to not be super active for 2-3 weeks (I am a runner and take boxing classes). So far my nose and breathing feels fine and is healing normally, but the past few days I have been experiencing super anxiety/restlessness/antsy behavior that I have never experienced before in my life. Let me explain a bit.

8 days ago I got the ""splints"" removed from my nose and had a minor complication the day after where my nose bled for 5-6 hours and I went to the ER and they packed it with the most painful ""rhino rocket"" thing up my nose that was the most pain I have experienced in my life. I immediately saw my ENT 6 hours later and she took it out and was pissed they didn't contact her (it was 3am). She said everything looks fine and is healing correctly and gave me the number to call if anything like that happens so she can be contacted.

I got relief that day and was able to take a nap/sleep but the next day I got a migraine I tried to wait out that kept me up all night but ended up taking my imitrex to relieve it. A few days later I got oral thrush (didn't know until the end of the day on Sunday when my Uncle told me what it was an not super serious) with a swollen uvula where I felt as if there was ""something stuck in my throat"" and driving me crazy.

On Sunday I think everything just hit me at once: not being able to workout, being cooped up in my house, the whole trauma of the bloody nose incident, the swollen uvula driving me nuts and not healing as fast as I wanted to, living alone with my dog, etc. I started pacing and my mind was racing to the point where I was like do I need to go to the ER for anxiety or do I need to call my doctor? I have no history of anxiety/depression and have never felt this way before. I am not even close to suicidal thoughts or any self-harm. 

I was able to sit with my Dad and talk for a few hours while watching the Red Sox then have Sunday dinner at my grandma's with my whole family and that helped a lot and by the end of Sunday/Monday I was feeling better (though the oral thrush is still annoying).

Today I had some restlessness/anxiety at work that started resurfacing again like on Sunday but talked to a co-worker who used to struggle big time with it for a bit. 

Is this normal after surgery? Any thoughts/recommendations/words of encouragement?",1
"Brain / Neuro issues? Hi all,

Like a lot of people with h.a., my biggest fear is having a brain tumor.

So, I've had some weird vision things for the past year and I've been to an opthalmologist twice (because the first time wasn't enough apparently). I sometimes see glittery floaters or what appears to be a quick line through my vision. Also, I sometimes have funky peripheral sparkles. My opthalmologist performed intensive tests and said my eyes look extremely healthy. 

I think I'm ""seeing"" these things because of my anxiety and stress of my life as a college student. It's just very concerning it doesn't seem to go away... But the doc probably knows best.

Also commonly, headaches are pretty common...

Finally, maybe once a year I'll have an ocular migraine where I get some weird vision tricks and my lips and fingers seem numb. Although these are probably nothing major I've been wanting to get an MRI just to be sure.

Mother thinks most of this is caused by me over committing to activities and my academic stress in college but some of these symptoms seem so real it's hard to not think it's a neuroloical issue. Ive been told to try deep breathing and  exercise. Have of you experienced these things?

Thank you everybody... :/ ",1

"I think I'm losing my mind Hello guys, long time lurker here. I've seen earlier a post about colon cancer anxiety so I decided to blow off some steam by telling my story.

It all started last summer, when I had a weird pain in my left abdominal area. Went to my GP, said it was nothing but that I should have a blood test (I was 20 at the time). I found out I had an important Calcium deficiency and after I took some supplements the pain disappeared. 

Fast forward to last week: that pain came back, exactly in the same spot. Now I'm going once or sometimes even twice a day, compared to my usual routine of once in two days. The pain fades away after bowel movements and that put me at ease for a couple of days, but today I saw in a stool some dark-brownish spots which I believed to be blood.

"Terrified of colon cancer Hi everyone,

I'm in full blown panic attack right now and I can't function properly because of it. I've practically convinced myself I have colon cancer. My symptoms are:

- blood while defacating (especially while constipated, but when I'm not I sometimes feel my anus hurt and see the blood on the paper then)
- diarrhea, constipation
- pain on the right side of abdomen for over a year now, it comes and goes, now it's mostly in my upper back
- extreme fatigue 
- I've had black stool once, but it was after drinking red wine so I thought then that's the cause

I'm also scared the cancer is already in my bones/spine, as my back often hurts and I can feel some kind of ""dent"" in my spine. 

I'm also diagnosed with severe anxiety (duh), so sometimes it's hard to tell which symptoms are real :( For example my fiancee tells this ""dent"" in my spine it's just my muscles contracting because of my anxiety. The same can be said about diarrhea, fatigue... But then again, how do I know when it's anxiety and when it's real?

I know I should just wait for the colonoscopy in 4 weeks, but I can't function properly right now. I've made mistake and visited a forum for colon cancer survivors and not only they all have symptoms similar to mine, but lot of them were very young, like me. 

My doctor told me it's probably IBS and hemorrhoids, but my mom had colon cancer at 50 and I've read it's getting more and more common in young people and here I am, crying myself to sleep every night, because I'm convinced I'm dying. What should I do?",1
"How to escape an HA hole when the symptoms persist? Iâ€™ve been sick for awhile with a diagnosed but generally not serious sinus infection, but lately Iâ€™ve been noticing some other things (which I wonâ€™t mention so you donâ€™t fall down the same hole Im in) and those things of course led me to the worst possible idea: Googling my symptoms. I came across something rare, sporadic, and deadly (of course) and Iâ€™m now constantly worried that itâ€™s something that could be far more serious. Even though I went to my general practitioner for the sinus infection today and mentioned the other strange symptom, I didnâ€™t mention the name of the specific thing I think I could have because it felt ridiculous and the symptoms were subsiding. He felt the area and chalked it up to side effects of the sinus infection, but of course since he didnâ€™t SPECIFICALLY say â€œitâ€™s not ____â€ and the symptoms have come back, iâ€™m now back to spiraling between â€œyouâ€™re just making it worseâ€ and â€œmaybe I should make sure just to be safe.â€  Any advice to get my mind off of the possibility when I still feel like Iâ€™m feeling the symptoms? 

I have this huge urge to go back to a doctor and get specific reassurance, but I know thatâ€™s problematic in the long run and could end up getting expensive for no real reason. Not to mention Iâ€™d feel a bit ridiculous.  Really starting to think I should see a psych, as I havenâ€™t since my anxiety began as a more generalized disorder a little over a year ago :/",1

"Balamuthia I have severe health anxiety. I go to therapy for it and had it well under control. However, in January, my ex husband passed away suddenly and unexpectedly. We have a daughter together. Since then, this shit has been out of control. I can't leave her parentless. I can't.

I thought breathing through my mouth would keep me safe. Wrong and stupid. By the time we get back inside, my nose is all stuffy and my throat hurts. I assume this is from dirt and allergens.

It is not possible for this to be run of the mill allergies or a sinus infection. My head doesn't throb or anything. It's a like a sinus headache, but very vague. I can move my neck and all just fine. I don't know if I have a fever. The kid hid the thermometer some where. It's messed up, I felt fine when I woke up this morning. No nasal problems.

"How to manage health anxiety when awaiting results. I have had health anxiety most of my adult life, it comes and goes, changes depending on my life stresses and what is happening.

I went for my annual skin check, and the dermatologist pointed out a mark on my face she wanted biopsied.

I have a long history of health anxiety. Canâ€™t get a cold without convincing myself I might be dieing. Frequent rabies scares.

"â€˜Palpable lymph nodeâ€™ - Iâ€™m terrified... So two and a half weeks ago, I went to the dentist with a tooth that was shaky after a previous filling had fallen out. Iâ€™d been feeling a bit weird in my throat, on the same side too. 

She looked it and firstly said, it appears I have gingivitis. 

She had to extract my tooth (surgically, by altering the gums) and said it was infected, so put some medicine in it and temporarily closed it. The next day, I went back and she opened it all up and then sutured my gums back together. 

When she checked my lymph nodes (mainly under my neck), I directed her to the mandibular node, which had been noticeably hard for maybe a week before. She called it a palpable node and said it could be due to the infection and the antibiotics (amoxicillin) she prescribed should take care of the infection. 

Well, almost three weeks later and Iâ€™m freaking the f*ck out. My infection appears gone and Iâ€™ve had no pain on that side since the extraction. 

My lymph node is still as palpable as before, but whatâ€™s worrying me is that itâ€™s painless, whereas when itâ€™s an infection itâ€™s usually quite tender? Itâ€™s hard but a bit rubbery and moves around. It couldâ€™ve been around a lot longer than just the three weeks itâ€™s been since I need to push it out a little from against my jaw to feel it - but I can REALLY feel it. 

I had a couple of random lumps in my armpit, groin and side as well, and whilst it felt hard, they had sort of pus coming out of the end so I assumed they were harmless as they went down after a couple of days. This was before the dentist. 

Iâ€™m scared itâ€™s lymphoma. The reason for this is:

-Night sweats - Iâ€™ve had this on/off for the past few years however. But Iâ€™ve noticed it again despite keeping cool. 
-Temperature regulation - out of nowhere Iâ€™ll get quite warm and then get a bit chilly again. 
-The node is pretty much painless but despite the infection going, itâ€™s still the same size and hardness. 
-General fatigue (but I have that anyways), recently itâ€™s been muscle aches
-Iâ€™m a smoker... and at times in the past year Iâ€™ve been very heavy. 

Iâ€™m just freaking the fck out. Can anyone let me know if they had anything similar? Or just put my mind at ease?

I know I should go to the doctors but Iâ€™ve just built up such a resistance to it with how much anxiety Iâ€™ve had over it. I fear having to face the issue and find out I have something serious.

I mean, dont you kinda have to check for eligibility like take a blood test and see what you lack and that sort of stuff or can you just be like ""ooh, i need some of iron, maybe some zinc"" etc. If it really doesnt matter than I have been thinking I should do the same.

"Would you go to the doctor again? Alright. This is a pretty long story... I haven't had a UTI for about 5 years (I'm a 27 yo F) but about a month ago, I was in China and got one. Went to the doctor to get antibiotics, took them for 5 days. 2 days later, I developed super intense middle super low abdominal pain that almost made me faint - Broke out into a sweat, couldn't stand, ears began ringing.

Went to hospital where they ran some tests and said the infection was still there, so they gave me another batch of antibiotics. These made me feel super ill every night (btw, at this point, the UTI stinging symptom is long gone) and by the 5th night I felt sick af and was vomiting.

Went to hospital the day after and I still had the infection. So, 3rd batch of antibiotics. Went to hospital the 3rd night because I was nervous I had a UTI that lasted so long. They told me I still had an infection and that it was severe, So I should stay at hospital. Didn't feel comfortable doing that in a foreign country, so I got on a plane to Melbourne (where I'm from) the next day. 

Dad picked me up and took me to hospital. I did indeed still have an infection so they gave me a new batch and sent me on my way - I was asymptomatic at that point. 3 days later, I have muscle aches in my leg, I start feeling super weak, and my heart rate was really high (180 when I arrived at emergency) shortly after being admitted, I developed diarrhea. Doctor on duty thought I might have an undertreated UTI, so they administered new antibiotic via IV. I was discharged the  next morning.

Considering how long this UTI lasted, I followed up and had a new urine test 8 days later (last Monday) Called my GP's office last Wednesday and the results were normal (yay!) But was feeling worried because since Tuesday, I felt ultra uncomfortable in that region down there. Had an ultrasound on Thursday and went back to the doctor on Friday explaining my concerns. He told me my test results from earlier in the week were completely normal so it was highly unlikely anything was wrong. Gave me some tablets they apparently usually give to ""old ladies"" with bladder issues.

Started feeling okay Friday night and Saturday. This morning (Sunday) I woke up and started feeling the same horrible, sharp pain that almost caused me to faint in China. It's right below my belly button, but at the pubic bone and it's SUPER fucking sharp and intense â˜¹ I've taken 6 paracetamol tablets today (spread out) But the pain hasn't completely disappeared. All this shit is making my hypochondriac tendencies go mental. It's almost 2:30am and I'm struggling to sleep because I feel so uncomfortable. I saw the doctor on Friday, I know, but this pain is fucking intense. Am I being paranoid or should I go back to the doctor tomorrow? I feel kinda stupid because he kinda laughed me off on Friday too... but... I'd also rather be safe than sorry. What would you do? ðŸ˜¦",1
"I might be dying, and my anxiety is going nuts I might have messed up yesterday. I'm an avid codeine user. I don't do hard drugs because I'm too scared of damaging my brain or other organs, but over the years, it has become increasingly difficult to lead a normal life without the help of a substance, considering that I have severe anxiety, depression, depersonalization, derealization and Pure O. So I started to consume codeine once in a few weeks in order to be able to function correctly, since I've tried around 20 antidepressants and SSRIs and nothing worked for me.

Yesterday, I took another dose. I buy OTC pain relief pills which contain codeine phosphate but they also contain paracetamol (acetaminophen) and aspirin and, in order to stay safe, you need to do a cold water extraction in order to remove the acetaminophen and aspirin from the pills. Opioids are highly soluble in water, so the codeine dissolves and the other ingredients  get filtered through a fabric and removed from the water, leaving a crystal-clear substance containing just codeine. However, I was in a hurry yesterday (stupid excuse to overlook my safety, I know) and I didn't wait long enough for the water to reach the right temperature (it needs to be around freezing temperature, but not frozen) and I did the extraction anyway. The water came out very milky and that is a sign that the extraction was not successful. I didn't know the water needs to be COMPLETELY clear and I didn't look it up...I took the substance anyway.

A few hours later I did some reserch and found out that I might have potentially intested 4 grams of paracetamol and 5 grams or aspirin. 4 grams of paracetamol is a risky amount, because it can cause liver damage. The liver, then, continues to self-destruct over a period of 2 weeks (!!!) without showing any serious physical symptoms so there's no way to know whether I overdosed or not...it ultimately leads to necrosis and then painful, slow death. 

&amp;nbsp;

I am at a loss and don't know what to do. My health anxiety is sky rocketing right now. I wish I would've been more careful but the deed is done now. Does anyone here have experience with paracetamol poisoning/overdose? I'm going nuts right now...",1

"Self-diagnoses, panic attacks, and hope Here's my story. Last summer I convinced myself that I had intestinal parasites and kind of lost it. I finally went to the doctor and it turned out to just be a yeast infection (health anxiety, right?). Well it was a really intense yeast infection. Got it under control after finishing medicine from doctor and then purchasing OTC medicine. 

Then I started noticing that my digestive system was totally out of whack, and was experiencing a constant fatigue and strange stomach aches that would appear out of nowhere in my lower abdomen. The aches would be sharp and burning, I felt like I got a ""hot flash"", and then they would go away after only 1 or 2 minutes and I'd feel fine. 

So I convinced myself I had a stomach ulcer (thanks, WebMD). I conquered my health anxiety once again and returned to the doctor. Up to this point, I've never had any real health issues in my life and pretty much never went to the doctor unless I got sick. (Except that I was diagnosed with high risk HPV, which had recently been clearing up. That's another story). So they do a breath test for H.pylori and take my blood. The blood test shows I have elevated bilirubin and they do an abdominal x-ray and ultrasound. No stomach ulcer. And nothing in the x-ray or ultrasound that indicates something wrong with my organs. 

Around this time I begin having panic attacks because I feel like something is very wrong with me. And then, my skin on my face goes insane. Small red bumps everywhere and flaking off all over and so much redness. I get a prescription cream, and it gets worse. I also get a prescription for a mild anxiety medication. The anxiety medicine makes me feel SO light headed, which triggers more anxiety because I feel light headed when I have a panic attack. 

I started a gluten-free diet because I felt like it matched some of my symptoms. Started taking probiotics every day and my digestive issues have gotten so so much better. I went in for a follow-up blood test that showed my bilirubin levels are now normal. I realized the lightheadedness of my medication was caused by consuming grapefruit. I've finally gotten my skin under control with daily chemical peels and tea tree oil and it's improved a lot, though still nothing like it used to be.  

So I've made a lot of progress. However I still feel very fatigued most days. While gluten-free has definitely helped, and I think I'm getting a better hold on my anxiety, in the back of mind I'm still afraid something is wrong. Can anyone relate? I'm reminding myself that I've made a lot of progress, and I think my initial health scare just triggered this health anxiety that I had never had before. ",1

"Stomach related cancer Hey guys....I've been having problems with my stomach lately, it started on September. Basically, I had tons of things to do on my uni, got really stressed out and started feeling like my stomach, or better yet the area above it felt heavy. I started running by that time and I ran almost every day until the real winter kicked in (around two month period). I also started eating more healthy and I stopped eating after 7PM for quite some time. While I ran I almost felt as if a weight was in my chest and as if it was jumping while I was running, so I visited my doc.

In the meantime, I lost quite some weight. I was usually around 100kg (+-5), and last time I tracked my weight I was at 83.

The doc basically said it's all stress related and she took my blood, urine and stool sample.

Stool -&gt; negative for H. Pylori
Urine -&gt; everything good, except high amount of proteins in urine (I had wisdom teeth extracted and took antibiotics a week before, so I'm not sure if it's related to that, if anyone has something smart to say regarding this...please do)
Blood -&gt; All good

She gave me a prescription for Controloc pills (proton pump inhibitor) and told me to take them for two weeks at least.

Well, newsflah. I'm stupid. First of all, I started taking them and the situation improved. So I stopped taking them after around 5 days, forgot one day and figured oh well, if it doesn't hurt it's fixed. Then, another period of high intensity workload on uni arrived and so did the pain. I started taking them again, but for a week and it improved a little. Later I figured I won't be my own doctor and I stopped taking them, so for a while I felt just a minor annoyance above stomach, but nothing alarming or hurting so I ignored it.

Now, back to another high intensity period, my stomach is going crazy again, I google, telling myself not to do it, but hey, I said I'm stupid didn't I?

The moment I read about bla bla cancers of this and that caused by gastritis I totally lost it.

If I had these symptoms on and off, considering I didn't take my meds as I was supposed to, how bad did I fk up my stomach? Could this half a year have made any permanent damage? I'm terribly afraid of well...pain, doctors, disease and death, nice combo, in fact so nice that it keeps me scared, but not scared enough to face my fear of doctors and operations.

Yesterday it was hell, I took 2x20mg Acipan (same thing as Controloc basically) and I feel a lot better, but my mind is still in a terrible place. I guess this turned out into a rant, rather than a question, but still... any comments are welcome.

sidenote: I read that the usual period of taking controloc or similar pills for such symptoms is at least 4 weeks, considering I didn't take even 1/4 of the given time, is it possible it's simply the gastritis coming back every time?",1
Hantavirus Spooked Me I'm 18 and my dad's place is hopefully on the tail end of a mouse problem. The problem is that his clean up procedure involves just vinyl gloves and bleachwipes.

"Helpful starter links for dealing with Health Anxiety **EDIT: I have found all the modules, a long with the parent link. I have now included all of them for you :)**

I, like many of you, have been dealing with debilitating health anxiety - specifically, concerning me focusing on my stomach, kidneys and waste (literally examining every urine and bowel movement).  I have been to the doctor 3 times already, have done 2x blood tests and a stool test, and everything came back okay, yet I am still unconvinced, a feeling I'm sure many of you can relate to.

I am going to keep searching for the rest of them, in an attempt to maximize the effectiveness, but for now, I'd figure I'd share these with you, friends.  Hopefully they help to bring some comfort to you.

"Have been getting sick fairly often This year I've been getting sick a lot. Back in October, I believe I had a flu. 102 fever for 5 days straight, respiratory symptoms, etc. but I never got swabbed. Then, in December I had a cold. I caught another cold again in January, and then Influenza A in February. Now just a week ago I caught another respiratory virus. It wasn't another flu because I got tested and the swab was negative, but it also seemed much worse than a cold (I had fevers up to 102). A week fever free but I'm still very congested. In between all of this I've had random sore throats as well. I'm worried something more is happening, whether it's some sort of auto immune problem or something else possibly worse. I'm getting a metabolic panel tomorrow, so hopefully that'll answer some of my concerns. I'm hoping it's just a vitamin deficiency, but of course my mind goes straight to something serious like cancer or something like that. This is also fairly recent of a problem. I've always had a lower immune system but I've never been this constantly sick. ",1

"Is face burning sensations something that can be attributed to anxiety? My life has been a big mess since August. A dizziness episode triggered my health anxiety. I suspected MS - did an MRI, an SSEP - they found nothing. Then, I moved onto ALS. Nothing again. Several neurologists said I had nothing but anxiety, and still I kept thinking the opposite.

In January I woke up with my right side tingling/pins and needles, followed by a toothache. Of course, I googled these symptoms and found Trigeminal Neuralgia - a condition that checks all the boxes of a hypochondriac nightmare.

I had a cavity, did a root canal, the toothache disappeared. But the tingling is still here and around my eye I have been dealing with burning sensations - eyelid, eyelashes, inside the eye. It's not unbearable and maddening like those who have trigeminal neuralgia say it is, but it's really uncomfortable.

I've seen two major neurosurgeons about this, they said I didn't have trigeminal neuralgia. I don't know, I can't find peace, I'm always startled, nervous and expecting to be hit by a major wave of unbearable pain. 

I really don't know anything anymore. Don't know if is my HA causing this, or if in fact I have this condition but doctors are simply being dismissive. One thing that makes me believe that my anxiety is the root is that the burning gets tuned down/disappears when I'm distracted. But it hits me again when I'm alone at home working, for instance.

Oh well, long post already. Anyone with similar experiences? Thank you",1

"Very scared about having an appointment scheduled at a cancer center. So April 18th I went to a free clinic because I canâ€™t afford healthcare, I had acid reflux. But the doctor ordered my feces to be examined for ulcers, that checked out fine, they also drew blood to see if I was ok. They scheduled a return appointment to see how my acid reflux was doing. The next day in a voicemail they left a message saying it was very important of me to keep my appointment bc my thyroid levels were low. I kept it. Returned for the appointment which was about 2-3 weekend later. We talked about my acid reflux for like a minute and then everything shifted to my thyroid. She said I have Hyperthyroidism and she wanted my neck to be scanned to see what kinda of treatment I needed which could be a pill taken for 1-3 years, surgery or radiation. The radiation part alarmed me so I asked immediately if it was cancer, smiling she said no. I went home looked up the symptoms of hyperthyroidism but only 1 or 2 seem to match. A week later I called back bc I never got a call to schedule my appointment they said I would be called Monday, again no call, Wednesday I get a call and I was scheduled for the appointment which is a 2 day process for some reason. Monday at 9:00, later at 2:00 then Tuesday at 9:00 again. Itâ€™s also in a cancer center which worries me so much and I canâ€™t stop thinking about it. Should i relax?

"Please give me some advice This all started about two months ago, I went about 4 days without eating to help me lose weight. That Thursday I decided to start eating again, so me and the family went to eat Mexican. I ate a small plate of fajitas (not spicy). On the way home I felt my heart rate go WAY up and started pounding really hard. Then I started to feel like my chest was tight and I couldnâ€™t breathe properly and my hands and face began to get pins and needles. The pins and needles spread all over my body and I got this enormous pressure in my lower diaphragm. All of my joints locked up and I couldnâ€™t move. I could speak but it was slurred. They took me to the ER and after taking several tests including a EKG a CT scan of my brain and a battery of blood tests, they concluded it was a low potassium level in my body, which triggered a panic attack. Ok. So the next Tuesday I went to my primary care doctor for a follow up to check my potassium level, and on the way I began to get that tingling and pressure in my chest again, I pulled over, got something to drink, and made it to the doctors office. Potassium came back fine. The feeling didnâ€™t go away. All the rest of that day I felt like I couldnâ€™t breathe. The next day I went to a minor emergency center and after even more tests on my heart lungs and veins, they concluded that I was fine and it was probably just anxiety. 3 days later. Went to the ER because the feeling still hasnâ€™t gone away and it is getting hard to live my life. Same thing, a bunch of tests and concluded nothing. Doctor said it might be a ulcer in my stomach and put me on medication. One week later and it only got worse. I went back to the ER and they took even more extensive tests and still found nothing. I was desperate to feel better, it had been two weeks of constant suffering. I went back to my primary doctor and he ordered more tests and a copy of the results from the ER. He found what appeared to be a â€œhiatus herniaâ€ in my stomach and gave me a acid reducer. It has gotten better but still hasnâ€™t gone away. It has been almost two months since that Tuesday and I havenâ€™t gotten even one minute of relief. My heart pounds constantly, my stomach bloats, Iâ€™m always cold, I have pain in my chest, I canâ€™t take a deep breath, and Iâ€™m always tired.

Probably a large insect like a dragonfly, but my mind immediately thought it was a rabid bat and it had just flew by and scratched me. A few days later I lay down to go to bed and I start feeling cold, my heart starts pounding, and I get scared and start googling. I had read a story about rabies on Reddit a while back that scared the shit out of me. I began reading the symptoms and convinced myself that I have only days to live. I donâ€™t believe rationally that I have rabies. My state has not had a human case in the last 30 years. But Iâ€™m so damn scared and there is nothing I can do about it. Any advice to make me feel better? I feel like I have fever but I have no temperature, and I feel a pressure in my face. I havenâ€™t slept in 2 days",1
"Pain in left thigh/leg and muscle spasms, freaked out about DVT again I've been afraid of DVT since early March because I have had various weird spasms and pain in my left leg. It happened twice that I woke up with immense pain and cramping in that leg. This happened to me when I was a kid sometimes, but I don't remember if it was just in one leg then. 



I've had two doctors tell me that my pain and symptoms don't match those of DVT and that I need to stop Googling, so I'm laying off the Google now...


The pain was mostly gone the last two weeks but right now I have a lot of cramp and a burning sensation in that same leg again and it seriously makes me anxious.



I also have another issue. I got meds for my anxiety: gabapentin and lexapro, but I am afraid to take them because of the possible side effects. I have been taking gabapentin but it only helps for a few hours. Lexapro seems more dangerous and I don't know if I'll just worry myself by thinking about the symptoms.

"Your honest opinions, please! Ok, so I have struggled with hypochondria for going on three years now. 

Last night, my girlfriend was puppy sitting for a coworker, and I stopped by to bring dinner and hang out with the cute puppy, for a while.

As puppies do, he was a little bit of a biter, and at one point he got in a little deep just above my elbow on my bicep. I pulled my arm away but it dragged a little bit and drew a little blood, so i assumed it punctured the skin. 

He's only a few months old, and apparently he went to the veterinarian four days ago. I haven't confirmed that he got a rabies vaccination there. I think he would have, but I don't remember what all my dog got when i took him home two years ago. This puppy who bit me came from a shelter. 

So, please tell me honestly: should I be worried about rabies? Should I go to the doctor just in case? I could use a level head's perspective on this.",1
"Terrified I have myocarditis and will suddenly die soon I've been suffering cold-like viral symptoms for the last 10 days, and I'm terrified the virus will attack my heart in a condition known as myocarditis. It began as a sore throat and a constant need to clear my throat, but has now progressed to a hacking, productive cough. I have also had some chest pain today, although admittedly it feels muscular.

Roughly 4 days into my symptoms (6 days ago now) I went to ER and they performed ECG and took blood. Cardiac troponins were not elevated and ECG was normal. However, I can't get my mind off the idea that because my viral symptoms have worsened, the virus is attacking my heart and I now have myocarditis.

Is it worth going to ER again for an ECG and cardiac troponins to put my mind at ease? I've been reading reports over at the myocarditis foundation website and what strikes me as particularly terrifying about this disease is its tendency to randomly cause sudden death without prior warning. 

I mean, as a health anxiety sufferer whose condition arises from a fear of death, this is the worst illness I ever could've learned about. ",1

Could an Acute HIV rash start as one bump and spread up the lower arms? I had a rash on my lower arms 3 weeks after possible exposure with no other symptoms. It started with one itchy bump and then it sort of spread around my arms but it wasn't too bad. I went to the doctor and he told me it's allergic reaction from switching body washes frequently. It was there for about a month or so. This was about 6 months ago and I did not feel the need to get tested. It crosses my mind every now and then so I wanted feedback.,0

Nodule in neck So I've had this bump under my skin near my jaw for about 6 months now. I went to the doc a few months ago and was told to come back if it doesn't go away. It didn't disappear so I returned and was scheduled for an ultrasound on my neck. The doc then sent me to get a CT scan of it. I'm worried that I've got cancer or something.

"It's officially affecting my every day life The anxiety meds aren't responding. I got finished with an eye doctor appointment who told me my eyes were fine (the initial cause of this), got one night of rest (after 3 weeks of anxious manic hell) and it started up the next day. It moved from my eyes to other health concerns. It just never stops. I've talked to my therapist but I don't know when I'll see my psychiatrist next. I'm losing sleep. I'm barely hanging in there. I'm being a good girl and staying away from google but still continuously performing body checks every few hours and obsessing over random sensations and tingles on my body. 

Sleeping is the worst. I can't at all. I toss and turn. Wake up from panic attacks. Have vivid nightmares. It's just all gone to hell after years of building up and I don't know what to do. I've attempted grounding, meditation, nature sounds, reassuring myself, etc etc. It builds back up.

I'm not sure where to go next or what to do. Maybe more doctor appointments, if it even helps anymore. Sometimes I think they're lying to me. Sometimes my brain tells me they either missed something or just aren't trained enough. I'm just crying right now because I feel so defeated.

"21M,FIRST TIME HERE, THANK YOU FOR ANY HELP GIVEN TO ME. Hi guys never posted here before however I am in a very dark place right now with my life and don't really know how to start this but for a while now I have felt very low and have felt as if I am becoming a different person as I no longer find happiness in myself as I did before, I am a university student also working in retail as well as recently being signed to a modelling agency and I often feel as if I have to put a happy face on everyday and I am honestly tired of having to do this it is physically as well as mentally draining. This feeling came around I would say at least a year ago and I kind of thought that it would pass as everyone does go through periods in their life were they feel low however it seems to have stayed and feels like a black cloud hanging over me which feels worse some days more then others , I come from a very loving family and live with my Mother and Stepfather as well as my younger 3 half siblings, I am very grateful for the luxuries I have in my life however there is so much going on within me some days I often wake up feeling very down for no reason at all feeling very worthless and lonely even though my family are very supportive and caring I couldn't ask for a better family. 

&amp;#x200B;

I believe my mental health has worsened due to finding out through family members that my biological father has been diagnosed with cancer and I guess this has made me realise that life really is so short and for some reason it has caused me to question myself asking "" I wonder if this is cancer causing?"" or "" what if I also get cancer one day?"" almost as if I have some sort of health anxiety and this is becoming an everyday moment, as a youngster my biological father was unable to be there for me and my mother due to his lack of love or care and the biggest blessing was my mother marrying again to a man who I can happily refer to as a real father, also a very close family member to me who I once spent a lot of time with has  recently tried numerous times to take their own life and being so distant from them for so long has not been a good feeling and has made me feel quite lonely as I am already an individual who does not really have true friends as I struggle to trust people, there have been many times were I have been invited out by others and have had to make up excuses for reasons not to go. There have been times were I have contemplated taking my own life as the feeling of worthlessness and sadness was at its most high, this feeling is very hard to explain and I am just looking for a bit of clarity on maybe why I am feeling this way or if others have experienced something similar I really would appreciate any help at all.

To individuals at work and university and others I meet I am often commented on being a very outgoing individual with a lot of confidence however deep down I often feel as if inside I am a totally different person which really does make me wonder how I became to be like this. I feel as if I lack the routine I once had in my life before and some days waking up feels as if I am just going through the motions, not long ago I would read everyday and would love to keep a journal to put my thoughts to paper, I remember heading to the gym 5 times a week running twice a week being full of energy living life to the fullest appreciating each day with those around me, where has the old me gone?. Often I have been told by others I am a very good-looking individual and in playful ways people have said"" You love yourself don't you"" or "" you are so cocky"" as I very much take pride in my physical appearance and enjoy doing my best to look as good as I can, the truth is recently I have been struggling everyday to keep a positive mindset and do the things I enjoy, having to put a mask on everyday is a task which I have become very familiar with I just want to know if others have felt the same and I would really appreciate any help which can be given I don't want to give up I don't want to carry on feeling this way I want the suffering to end or at least made easier.

Thank you for taking the time to read this I apologise for any grammatical mistakes it is quite late in the night right now. ",1
"Panic attack head pain throat closing. Help 
Hi there 

I have a reoccurring panic attack. I get throat tightness like I can't breathe or swallow , my arms and legs will tingle, I get dizzy, my heart races, I think the end is here. Then after this part passes(5--25mins) I feel very tired and get sharp head pains. I'm terrified of having an anaphylactic reaction so I take Benadryl when I feel the throat tightness but I've been tested and have no allergies. 

Anyone else???

Panic disorder and HA SUCK.

"Just had the worst panic attack Was at my moms for dinner. Had a plate in the kitchen when I all of a sudden didnâ€™t feel too great, kinda faint. Tried to walk it off and got dizzy, tunnel vision, sweaty and heart rate was through the roof. Seriously felt like I was about to die so I told my mother and wife. 

They sat me down and calmed me but it felt like it took forever. I just about told them to call an ambulance because I was sure it was the end. Easily the worst and scariest panic attack Iâ€™ve ever had. 

Fuck, I thought I was doing better. ",1
"Iâ€™m so tired of it all, but I canâ€™t stop thinking something is wrong with me. Iâ€™ve never had health anxiety, but Iâ€™ve been blessed with plenty of other types. Lately HA seems to be my primary form.

Back in August I visited the ER for 104 degree fever that affected my vision, in October urgent care sent me to the ER for an uncharacteristic migraine. In November I started getting chest pain, which sent me to the ER several times out of fear. After numerous EKGs, blood tests, a stress test, and event monitor setup Iâ€™m told Iâ€™m fine, but have some PVCs. 

Iâ€™m still getting the chest pains, palpitations, and headaches, and multiple doctors ranging from primary care, to ER, to neurologists, to cardiologists all attribute it to stress. 

Last year my blood pressure used to be 121/73 when visiting the doctor, but lately itâ€™s skyrocketed to 150/88 in the office. Taking it at home I average about 128/76, but I can see my pulse go up when I take it.

Iâ€™m so scared about a multitude of things happening to me and I canâ€™t stop thinking about the unknown. I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m really okay or if thereâ€™s something wrong with me with the constant headaches and other symptoms.

How do people deal with this?",1
"Anyone find going to the gym tough? So I try to get to the gym as often as possible as I know how good it can be for mental health and to get back to my previous standard of fitness. However, since getting HA I find it difficult as I keep focusing on my heart rate after sets or after a bit of cardio; I keep thinking â€˜is that too high?â€™ â€˜How long will it take to return to normal!â€™ â€˜I only did 5 reps why is it beating so hard!?â€™

Really annoying that I canâ€™t enjoy the gym as I keep thinking about how my heart is doing!

Wonder if anyone else is the same, and if so what they do to help!

"Canâ€™t function properly due to fear of MS A few years ago I was involved in a serious car accident and developed quite severe anxiety. Shortly after this I started experiencing numbness and tingling down my left side, went to the GP thinking it was MS and was basically laughed out of the surgery. Went to a walk in centre and was told it was anxiety. 

Over the years Iâ€™ve occasionally gotten numbness / tingling in my left side. Sometimes the left side seems weaker but itâ€™s subjective not objective. 

Recently someone I knew from high school was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Since then Iâ€™ve experienced loads of tingles and numbness in my left arm, hand and foot. Iâ€™m terrified itâ€™s MS and have spent a lot of time in bed over the past few days researching MS, crying, and doing neurological tests on myself over and over. Iâ€™m convinced I have it and my life is over. I just moved somewhere near and havenâ€™t registered with a GP yet so itâ€™s going to take a few weeks to get an appointment. ",1

But this shouldnâ€™t be how I bring in the New Year. I should be looking forward, I should be looking to tackle the year head on and look to fulfil my potential. This time next year, as we approach 2020, I want to be living my life to the full and not feel crippled by how my mental health perceives my physical health. 

I am so scared of dying, that I donâ€™t spend anytime living. And that is a travesty that I must fight against. ",1
"mole anxiety Hi. i'm glad to have come across this group because nobody understands my anxiety. Since having children, my anxiety has become really bad. I fear I'm not going to be around for my children. I've had a fear scares too and I have some chronic health problems. I'm on holiday now and noticed a mole was raised and a pink. I don't know how long it's been that way. I can't see a doctor for a few more days either. I scratched it a few weeks ago and the top of it came off and now the scab is sort of a shiny pink underneath. The mole seems to have been there for a year or so, but not before that (I did look at previous photos of myself). It's grown in size and changed to pinkish tinged. I am so nervous. I keep imagining that i'll die from this because I read that some pink melanomas can be life threatening in 6 weeks or so. It's awful. I have a 3 year old and a 1 year old so it's even more devastating. My husband doesn't understand. ",1

Just like a tiny little zit. It does seems smaller and less red but thereâ€™s still this tiny darker dot right next to it. WHY IS IT STILL THERE???? Ugh and I have to convince my parents somehow.

"Health anxiety when sick Hi everyone,  


I've had issues with GAD for the past 10 years, it's something I've learned a lot from, and managing it usually is not terrible difficult. In late November I came down with a cold, which in turn became a sinus infection. I've had semi-noticeable issues with my sinuses for the past two years but nothing crazy, mainly decreased sense of smell, and having a stuffy nose. During this time, I became paranoid of various fatal diseases, I had a ton of different symptoms, some that can be related to sinus stuff, some anxiety things. I've had a few ups and downs throughout the last month and a bit, at one point having almost a full week anxiety free.   


Anyways, do you guys have any recommendations for dealing with HA when you have an actual medical thing going on with it's own symptoms? I am currently paranoid about some kind of Bacterial Meningitis, which, while being rational is kind of a ridiculous fear. Going to the doctor is also a bit of a challenge, I can't get a GP in my city (In Canada) and have to use health clinics. I haven't had any of the super thorough scans, tests, etc. Which also makes me a little paranoid, even though I know it's recommended not to go down that rabbit hole. I feel like my mind gets incredibly caught up in that minuscule chance that it's something serious and my ignoring it is going to be the nail in the coffin.  


  
I also just wanted to mention that I know this is a positive experience for me, even though it's kind of miserable. I don't want to be overly negative, as I have had my good days during all of this, and I try to keep positive even when things seem incredibly bleak and dreary. ",1
"Brutal bowel movements after eating and random, constant burning sensation in chest all day no matter what Hi all, just wondering if anyone else has dealt with this, my health anxiety is improving, no more panic attacks, googling has gone way down, but my stomach just wont seem to improve and this burning in my chest right between the collar bones seems to be completely random. I don't feel particularly anxious, I cant even recognize it right now, just kinda deflated to be honest but I know my thoughts remain on my health just way less intense than they were. I Don't really enjoy eating because I know whats in store for me and have gone from 187lbs to 164lbs. I had an endoscopy that they said was clear, I'll most likely need to have a colonoscopy (doctor said) and going to see a lung specialist soon. If that stuff comes up clear which it probably will any advice how you help ease your stomach? Worst part is my diet is way better than it was so like \*should shrug\* I'm thinking of taking CBD oil but iono at this point, just lost. I try not to think about the burning and the bowel pain but its so in my face its hard not to. ",1
"Penis skin So I was receiving oral from a woman a few days ago and she was a little rough. I was left with raw, grazed irritated skin on the head of my penis.

I don't get it is rare, but is it so rare that only few people with genetical issuses should worry about that?",1
"its back.... i was doing so well for so long with my hypochondria but all of a sudden its back. my mind is going crazy. been a while since i visited this thread.

what has me all paranoid is last night, i was at a party with about 15 people. I went to the bathroom and when i wiped and put the toilet paper in the toilet, i noticed a little bit of red on it like blood.  i thought i was getting my period but i wasnt. i didnt see any blood after that. 

so now, I am worried that it was someone ELSES blood on the toilet paper and am concerned about being infected with HIV now. Ugh. my biggest fear. 

The reason I worry is because one person who was at the party is a gay male, and I am unsure of his status.. what if he was sabatoging the toilet paper with his blood?!

I HATE THIS ANXIETY! Literally no rational thoughts here. ",1
"I am just glad I have found you I have been struggling with severe health anxiety for the last six months. In the past year my life has been turned upside-down: I was bullied on my workplace, I moved to the UK from Italy and my parents divorced. And although I am living with the most wonderful man I have ever met, and I am finally doing what I love in a city I adore I feel completely BROKEN. Every night I go to bed thinking about the fact that a tragedy is meant to happen sooner than I could imagine, and that a terrible unnamed illness will take me away from the love of my life and from my dream of becoming a museum curator. Every day I make an effort to get up and I immediately start checking my breasts and my neck for lumps. I feel exhausted. I only wish I could be able to enjoy a pleasant evening at the restaurant without a cruel voice inside my brain whispering that my happiness is not meant to last. I do not want to live like this anymore. I am 27, I have the holy right to be happy and healthy and to enjoy my life. This is so unfair.
I wanted to thank you guys for putting into words all the things I constantly feel deep inside my chest. You made me understand that I am not alone in this. And I know that someday we'll get all the happyness and the peace that we deserve. ",1

"Blood test results Hi all. 

Little backstory. I recently went to my doctor for some chest pains I have been having. I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder since I was roughly 19. 

These chest pains have always been an on and off thing with me, I've had scans out the wazoodle and also blood work over the years that has shown nothing.

Today my doctors receptionist called me to inform me my most recent blood work results were in (I had the blood work done roughly 3 weeks ago). This is terrifying to me as they have never called me before in results to blood work results.

My mind is pacing thinking they found something horrible as it was not discussed over the phone, I have an appointment tomorrow morning to go over the results with the doctor. My mind is going nuts thinking I have cancer or diabetes or something very life threatening has been found.

I dunno I just needed to write this down, makes me feel a little better in a way.",1
"Coping methods you use? (venting) I was finally approved and am able to afford health care and I scheduled an appointment for the GP and the Dentist because of a small bump I have sort of under/in front of my ear by my lower jaw on the right side.

But I am sort of terrified, and am obviously fearing the worst, I just wanted to know what coping methods you have. 

Bleh. I'm sorry I need to vent a little too. I've always had one tonsil larger than the other on the right side too, and I like freaked out about it when I was 15 or 16, but it never grew or anything. I've had jaw pain on and off for a few years I think mostly when my wisdom teeth started growing in. I also get earaches, tinnitus, and jaw popping (again mostly on my right side). I know this sounds like tmj, but now I found this bump and I am just terrified the bump has been something more sinister, and I could never afford to do anything about it, and I am just ashamed of myself. 

Also like I need to get work done on my teeth, and I am just a mess. I am happy I got insurance finally so I can see a doctor and maybe a therapist tbh. Bleh. I'm sorry if this is triggering for you guys, I am in such a bad place mentally at the moment, and I feel incredibly alone. It's gotten to the point where I kind of wonder why I am here sometimes. 

Like trying to be positive is so difficult. I try but it never sticks, and I don't know how I got here. 

I am so sorry if this is triggering at all to anyone. If anyone has any coping skills, or ways to distract yourself that would be incredibly helpful. I'm already doing the ""don't google your symptoms"" while I wait for my dr. appointment (which is on the Feb. 1). So anything you got, let me know.

weight loss I feel I should mention I've always been underweight with a high metabolism. I was recently sick last week with bronchitis which made me lose my appetite and since I've healed I also have stppped smoking weed. My eating habits are coming back but one thing that is concerning me is over the course of that week and a half I have lost 6-7 pounds.

"My story of chronic chest pain and health anxiety Six weeks ago I (M26) was keeled over in bed clutching my chest. I felt a pain on my left side that felt deep and biting. It subsided shortly but since then I had what felt like a mass in my chest. Iâ€™m not new-comer to chest pain either. Last year I was diagnosed with having PVCs (preventricular contractions) which are benign but ended up requiring me to get a Halter monitor and Echo. Those results indicated my heart was fine. Now, however, I was panicked thinking I might have a respiratory problem. I started googling lung cancer symptoms, bone cancer symptoms, the whole nine yards. One night, I had a full blown panic attack thinking I was going to die from what felt like a huge tumor growing in my chest. And that damn pain never went away, I paid attention to the tightness I felt in my chest all the time, it was inescapable. While at times I would be distracted and not notice it, a large portion of my day is spent studying and during those times of quite my mind would be drawn to the tightness I was feeling. I should also mention Iâ€™m in medical school, so learning all of the pathologies that could happen to a person made anything I felt be drawn to the worst diseases Iâ€™ve since come to learn. 

It was only last week that I actually discovered this subreddit, and I became sure my chest pain was related to anxiety. The anxiety of school, the anxiety of my chest pain, and the anxiety I had regarding my own mortality after a recent friend passed away. And what made it worse was that all of these things were acting as a positive feedback loop. For example, Iâ€™d stress about an exam, which would provoke my chest pain, which would make me more anxious which lead to worse chest pain and on and on. Maddening. Even though I knew how incredible rare it would be for a young non-smoker to be diagnosed with a disease like lung cancer, it was always where my mind went. 

In order to rule out actually having a physiological problem, I got an X-ray done today and it came back negative for anything. Though, I question if that was the right thing to do. I donâ€™t want to be a hypochondriac, and get needless and expensive tests done. And in some ways I felt like I â€œgaveâ€ in to my emotions. However, Iâ€™d be lying if I said I wasnâ€™t much more relaxed knowing that my problem stems from anxiety, and not pathology. 

I write this only to say that chest pain is scary, but more often not a life-threatening ordeal. I hope to calm those who come here freaking out about a symptom similar to mine. And while I still have the pain, I now understand it and accept it. 

Our bodies are weird, and no one has the same body as you or will experience the same symptoms as you. My body likes to give me chest pains which are sometimes chronic, sometimes short, sometimes after a tough exercise. But after having run the gamut of tests, Iâ€™m actually just - fine. 

TL;DR: Chest pain turned out to be nothing but anxiety after extensive testing. Youâ€™re fine. ",1
"Heart Palpitations Stopped--Empty Feeling hello everybody! i've been dealing with cardiophobia for 2 months now, ever since i went to the ER for a fast heartrate that wouldn't stop. everything is fine with my heart, i've had loads of EKGs, chest x-rays, and bloodwork done. the month following, however, i could always feel my heartbeat in my chest. i would often put my hand on my chest to feel it beat to calm me down. i got put on anxiety meds and now my heartbeat isn't palpitating like it was, in fact, i only feel my heartbeat in my wrist pulse now. it's fine, i guess that's normal, but ever since it's stopped i've had this empty feeling in my chest. it's probably psychological, but it makes me nervous sometimes that i can't feel anything there. thanks for listening to me, if anybody else has any wisdom or similar experiences, I'd love to hear it!",1

Worried about my stomach Started last night. I was drying clothes and I felt my stomach balloon up with gas so bad that I couldnâ€™t stand. It wasnâ€™t painful just uncomfortable. I started to panic.

B: jump to a conclusion that you are probably dying and seek medical advise.

"Worried about my gallbladder - how to stay calm until my next ultrasound. (Quick background: I've had health anxiety since my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer, and it's gone through the roof in the year &amp; a half since she died.)

A year ago my doctor discovered a small polyp on my gallbladder. It was only 3mm, but he decided to monitor it anyway just in case, which means an ultrasound every 6 months for 2 years. During my second ultrasound, the polyp was a little bigger -- this time, 4mm -- and my doctor seemed worried. But he seems like he gets worried easily, so I don't really know how I should feel... 

My mom's gallbladder was removed for a variety of reasons at 45, and it turned out hers had precancerous cells (cells that look a bit off and may develop into cancer). So my family history has me worried. I'm also concerned because (a) it's a single polyp, and single polyps are more likely to be cancerous, and (b) it's growing, albeit slowly.

I keep trying to tell myself that I'm young (mid-twenties) and that gallbladder cancer is EXTREMELY unlikely in anyone under 40, but I can't shrug this awful feeling. Gallbladder cancer kills 85% of people within 5 years (though most people are diagnosed late-stage, so who knows what my odds would be if I actually had it).

"Chest Pain Hi, I'm hoping you lovely people can help me with this.
I'm 21F, not super healthy but not overweight, just eat not-so-well.
A few weeks ago I got really sick for about 2.5 weeks. I had awful diarrhea, couldn't swallow, drink, eat, no appetite, was naseuas, had chest pains and had very high heart rates. Over this period I got 3 blood tests, a stool sample, 2 (abdominal) CTs (where you could see a bit of my chest), and a chest x-ray. Nothing came back positive. Eventually I started feeling better and started going on with my life. What may be somewhat important information is that my dad is a surgeon and I work reception for him, he had similar problems a few weeks before me.

For the last few days, I've had some loose-ish stools, a bit of weakness/fatigue, but mainly I'm concerned about a dull pain that moves around my chest. Today it's mostly been on my left side and about 30 min ago went into my left shoulder. Its not constant and it can be lower right, upper left, whatever.

"terrified of being pregnant hiii

"Shin indent / wearing socks? Hi all. First off I've seen about 3 doctors through my University and they have all said what I have is 'normal asymmetry'. On my inner, left shin there's this relatively thin 2.5 inch long indent feeling where the muscle/tissue just doesn't seem to be there...or maybe it was damaged. The docs told me that so long as it doesn't impede any daily functioning, hurt extremely bad, grow, or (and this is the biggest one) eventually protrude that I am healthy and in my head.

"Terrified of catching the flu after ENT visit. I've been a huge germaphobe for as long as I can remember. In the spring and summer it usually doesn't cause me to much distress, but once cold and flu season pick up, it starts to have a greater impact on my mental health and my ability to function. 

Earlier today, I had my bi-yearly appointment with my ENT to get my ears cleaned out (I produce a ton of wax). I was super anxious going into the appointment as there is a very bad cold going around my area right now, and the flu is widespread. I took hand sanitizer with me and was prepared to grab a mask if the waiting room was busy. 

Thankfully, there wasnt a single patient in the waiting room. I was called back quickly,  the nurse took some info, I sanitized my hands, and then my ENT entered the room. He shook my hand, and then sanitized his, and got to work cleaning me out. 

Once he finished I asked a quick question about how to avoid facial and ear pain on a long flight, and he suggested the vasalva maneuver. He demonstrated it for me, and then asked me to try it. Ordinarily, I dont touch my face under any circumstances, but since I had just sanitized my hands and since I was just pinching the outside of my nose (I was careful not to get too close to my nostrils), I figured it would be okay. So I pinched my nose very briefly and went on my way. 

On the drive home I started to think about it a bit more, and realized that after I sanitized my hands, I shook his hand, so my hands probably were not very clean when I pinched my nose shut. And I started to get really worried that in doing so, I probably exposed myself to tons of cold/flu germs that will infect me in the coming days. 

Now I'm anxious as can be, trying to find some rational reason why I shouldn't be worried here, so I can calm down a bit. I havent had any luck yet. Can anybody help me out here? 

Also, just for the record, I'm seeing a therapist twice a week to help with these things. We just started back in October, but unfortunately he's been out of town all of December for the holidays. I've backtracked a good bit in his absence. I'm also more anxious than usual about getting sick because I have a vacation coming up next week and I really dont want to have a cold/flu while traveling.

"how to control heart rate while at the doctors? hi!

so not only do i have health anxiety, but i have a HORRIBLE fear of the doctor. it's something new that started right around the same time as my health anxiety (yay)

while i have a resting heart rate in the upper 70s, my heart rate shoots at the doctor because i'm so anxious - even into the 140s. that's the biggest issue i have with my anxiety, is my heart just starts to RACE, and once it starts to race i panic even more. it takes a while to convince the doctor that it's not normally like that( i show them my apple watch averages lol) - and usually they'll take it at the end too (i've basically trained myself to be so scared when they DO take it, so right after they take it, i'm absolutely fine and the anxiety is gone).

"Wtf is going on in my head? Normally I'm good at handling this, but I really need reassurance tonight. I rolled over in bed and accidentally strained the right side of my neck a bit too much. I immediately felt discomfort and started to get a dull pain shooting up my neck and into my head, all on the right half. My face felt numb-ish and now feels... not swollen, but I guess 'puffy' is the best way to describe it? I have a dull headache on the right side of my head. Totally freaking out.

growing pains but iâ€™m done growing??? iâ€™m a 17 year old female. my doctor said iâ€™m done growing and iâ€™ve been the same height since around 7th grade. sometimes in the night when trying to go to sleep i have really bad â€œgrowing painsâ€ in my thighs and behind my knees. it wikl also wake me up in the middle of the night. iâ€™m really scared that itâ€™s actually a blood clot in my leg. iâ€™m not sure how often this happens but i know itâ€™s fairly often and i always just chalk it up to growing pains even though that canâ€™t be it..,1
"Does anyone else have pelvic floor pain after multiple ejaculations in a short period of time. Lately I masturbated two times in a short period of time (within about 1 hour I guess) after the first ejaculation I had no pain in my lower area.

"Helping Twin Brother Deal With Health Anxiety My twin brother (23, m) has been suffering an extended episode of anxiety for about a month regarding terminal illness and neurodegenerative diseases. Two years ago he needed to have surgery for Thoracic Outlet Syndrome, which was a major anxiety-causer. Long story short, his arm swelled up and he needed to be taken to the hospital, learned he had blood clots in his lungs, and spent the rest of the year on blood thinners to prepare for his first major surgery. Since then, he's been extremely wary of any aches and pains he feels. This December, his arm started hurting, and he got an infected salivary gland. That, combined with it being around the two year anniversary of his surgery, triggered major anxiety symptoms. Since then he's had aches and pains, tingling, fatigue, headaches, all proportional to the level of anxiety he feels at the moment.

He recognizes this, too. He knows that anxiety, something we have been officially diagnosed with, combined with the hyper-sensitivity that comes from being on the Autism spectrum, is the most logical explanation for his symptoms. But there's always that doubt, and that causes more anxiety. According to the anxious part of his brain, he's had MS, some kind of cancer, or some obscure disease that he read about on Wikipedia at some point. We have no family history of cancer, MS, or any weird diseases, and we live extremely healthy lifestyles. He even went to his doctor to see what they thought. His blood pressure is perfect, and a blood test came back with the only problem being a Vitamin D deficiency. His therapist has assured him that everything he's feeling is textbook anxiety. Despite this, he still gets panicky about every little twinge he feels. It's making him to lose sleep, causing him to feel tired and fatigued during the day and giving him more anxiety. It's a self-sustaining cycle.

Him, describing what it's like to be in the middle of an attack: ""I feel like I'm dying and no one believes me.""

Now, I suffer from health anxiety myself, but for different reasons. I hate catching colds, because they're basically a constant sensory overload for me. Besides that, I've had existential crises, and a bout of Alice In Wonderland Syndrome (yes, really), but all of these things are or were made far worse by my anxiety about them. I've been able to get through to my brother by talking about my own experience, but that only seems to work temporarily.

I'm looking for advice: Does anyone here have family members with health anxiety? If so, how do you help them? Has anything worked for you? I hate seeing my brother deal with this, and I just want to do what I can to help.

"Weird symptom I've been having that scares me. So for the past year I've been having this weird symptom on and off, and it freaks me out every time. It only happens when I get out of the shower. My toes will turn noticeably bright red while the rest of my foot remains regular skin color. When this happens they are also very hot when you touch them. There's no pain, numbness or tingling, Just extremely red. Normally it only happens when I get out of the shower, but I got off the couch tonight and it happened. I've done a lot of research on the possibilities and the most common answer is peripheral artery disease and that terrifies me. I suppose I'm just looking for some insight at the moment.

"A person with health anxiety did the 23 and me health test and doesnâ€™t know how to deal with the results. Hi everyone. I am a 20 year old female. Long story short I watched my grandpa, who has been my father figure all of my life, die of a heart attack suddenly after years of going to the cardiologist for monthly checkups being told he was fine. Since then, Iâ€™ve had debilitating anxiety which has mostly caused me to be a serious hypochondriac. You name it, I thought I had it. Iâ€™ve been through all the typical anxiety symptoms that have caused me to go to countless doctors getting brain scans, blood tests, etc. Iâ€™ve never checked out therapy due to always going to medical doctors. When they canâ€™t find anything I donâ€™t trust them I fear them from what they did to my grandpa. I stay up at night thinking about how they didnâ€™t find something that is seriously wrong with me like the cardiologist couldnâ€™t find my grandpas heart attack before he died from it. I have such a fear of death itâ€™s probably insane. 

My main question here is this: I got a 23 and me kit with the ancestry + health for Christmas (like most people!) I was never worried about Parkinsonâ€™s since it was never talked about on my moms side of the family. I donâ€™t know my dad personally, I only know of him. I knew he was Italian (which matched to what my reading was saying) but I never knew anything else. I had 2 variants detected in my health report. One major variant detected for Parkinsonâ€™s the GBA gene and one variant for Gaucherâ€™s disease (meaning Iâ€™m a carrier.) When I say I was shocked I mean I was shocked. My mother never mentioned anything about Parkinsonâ€™s on either of my sides. I linked my results up with my moms results (she also had the test) and she also has a variant detected for Gaucherâ€™s disease (she gave it to me Iâ€™m guessing) but she doesnâ€™t have one for Parkinsonâ€™s only I do. 
The more research I do the more I want to cry. From what Iâ€™ve been reading I understand that I am at a high risk for Parkinsonâ€™s from my gene being a GBA and having Gaucherâ€™s. I see that I am at risk for early Parkinsonâ€™s the one that causes the most cognitive decline very early in life. I have health anxiety to begin with (yes I know I probably shouldnâ€™t have done the test) but I really was never expecting THIS. I donâ€™t know where to go from here or what to think. I donâ€™t know what I should do. All my research through various websites, scientific journals, and forums are telling me about what high of a risk I have for early Parkinsonâ€™s. I canâ€™t sleep at night after finding this information. My heath anxiety has been through the roof. How serious is this? 
Please no judgement.

"Rabies fear Hello everyone, back again, this time with a rabies scare.

I got a new cat about 3 months ago, and she's a community stray from kind of the outskirts of Philadelphia. She's about 9 months old now and very rambunctious, and quite a cutie.

However, as she is rambunctious I somehow started looking into whether or not she could have rabies. She runs around like crazy, rolls around a lot, and loves biting me. Like, LOVES biting me. Definitely drawn blood a few times, no infections due to careful cleaning after. 

I read that rabies usually shows 2-3 months after infection, and upwards of a year, so theoretically if she was bitten before I got her (she's 100% an indoor cat now) she could start showing symptoms. 

Is it at all possible, or am I being a doof?

Also, should mention, got her all of her shots after taking her in. Not sure if that matters for rabies.

Thank you all!",1

"Anxie-tips. Or not really. Just a story of my anxiety and how im not taking shit from it anymore Eight years ago, i was diagnosed with chronic anxiety. That time, i shrugged it off thinking, ""hey, this is normal, right? Everyone gets anxious sometimes. This will go away, right?"" Wrong. Here i am, eight years later, cringing at past me for even thinking that anxiety goes away like a seasonal flu.

I spent some time going through therapy sessions, and while those helped, they didnt really cure me of my anxiety*, because for people like me, anxiety is ever-present -- an annoying, unwanted companion i am eternally cuffed with.

I struggled battling anxiety for a long time. It was hard to be a fully-functional human when every speedbump looked like a giant boulder in the middle of the road. Instead of looking for ways around it, my focus was on the speedbump-boulder and how impossible it was to conquer it. Anxiety paralyzed me and made me feel like i was always bound to fail.

The smallest tasks would sometimes trigger anxiety and panic. I would cross the road planning my funeral because what if the bus hits me? I would get invited to parties, and yes i craved to socialize, but i would bail because what if i spill the drink and make a mess of myself? Public speaking was the worst subject ever, because that triggered so much what-ifs. I was sweating with just the thought of mispronouncing words and forgetting my lines. There were days when i thought i was perfectly fine, then i would be attacked by constant panic and pressure that took away my ability to function, and i would shut myself in, because anxiety was crippling that way.

I quit a lot of things in my life -- school, jobs, relationships -- some, i didnt even get to start, all because i worried i wasnt good enough. I was scared of taking a course i wanted because what if i couldnt find a job after i graduated? I couldnt take these programs because what if i fail them and i had to retake them? I resigned from my teaching job because i feared no one would take my subjects the following year, that i might not be a good enough instructor. I was scared to build relationships and would stop talking to people i really liked or wanted to be friends with, because what if they dont understand me?

Because that was what i felt, that no one understood me. I craved validation and support, but instead, some of the people i cared about left me for being ""over-dramatic"" and a ""cry-baby,"" only because they didnt understand what i was going through. Well, same. How could i blame them when i myself couldnt understand it?

After years of battling anxiety, i got fed up with it and i internally told it to fuck off. It didnt. But i knew i had to do something about it, or else, i wouldnt be able to really live. I knew that there was only so much i could do to help myself. So i did. I read self-help books, which, if i would be honest, really didnt help that much because they all say the same things i already knew (still good reminders, though). I started reaching out to my fellow anxious people and asked for advice, because, you know, it takes one to know one, and they were the best people to talk to if i wanted to really get myself. Little by little, i gained confidence about who i was and what i was capable of. It took years and a lot of hard work, but i learned so much, and i couldnt be any more thankful to the people who helped me and made me feel a little better about myself.

Fast forward to a few years later. I cant say that i dont get anxious anymore. After all, anxiety is already a big chunk of who i am. Maybe i just learned a few tricks to manage it somehow. Or maybe it just doesnt scare me as much as it did before.

The fact is, there is no one-size-fits-all approach in managing anxiety. Some people fight their anxiety. Some people try to ignore it. If it works for you, then it must be for you. But if there's one thing i realized for myself, it's that fighting my anxiety is a losing battle, so i embrace it instead. I take a break. I breathe. I ground myself to my surroundings. This way, i know that i have control of the environment im in. I recognize the situation and try as much as possible to think logically. I acknowledge the facts, and while i cant really do anything about my emotions, i talk about the situation to the people who care to listen. If im alone, i express what upsets me through writing. I walk. I go for a run. Not to try to escape the situation, but to shake off the excess nerves. I look back to what makes me anxious and assess what i can do about it. If i need to take a break and feel the emotions as they happen, i allow myself a few hours, or maybe a few days to let it run its course. I think to myself, ""it will pass."" It always does.

To my fellow anxious people, you got this. It is a hard road, and you may sometimes feel alone, but youre not. Be kind to yourselves. If you need to cry, do it. If you need to rest, take as much break as you need. If it's too much to bear alone, seek help.

To everyone else, anxiety thrives in a person's inability to take control of a situation. When someone feels lost, it is important that they feel secured, heard, and validated. This is why it is important to show kindness and compassion to everyone.

"I've been making a fool of myself for the past month This is going to be long, sorry. I just really wanted to let this all out and I figured this is the best place to do it.

I've always had a little bit of health anxiety, but it typically subsided very quickly. It was never something that had an effect on my life until recently.

One night in early December I was playing a video game for several hours and barely moved. Eventually I had a pain shooting up my left leg and it appeared to be swollen. My mom suggested I pinched a nerve, but I just knew it was a blood clot. My symptoms were a mild pain in my leg and ""swelling"", Google told me I was about to die, and I was thoroughly convinced.

A few days pass of me obsessing over this. I read about DVT for hours every single day. I'm basically an expert on it at this point. I know all about taking blood thinners and the effect it could have on your period. I was preparing myself for this life.

I measured my legs to compare them many times a day. This had me believing the ""swelling"" wasn't going down. Turns out the left side of me is just fatter than the other half and I never noticed it because the difference is literally less than a cm. Was I *ever* swelling? No idea. My mom measured her own legs to show me a difference in the size of your legs was normal, which only kind of comforted me. Briefly wondered if she too was dying and didn't know it.

Somewhere around this time I thought I had sleep apnea because one night my anxiety was so bad that I was jolting awake every time I started dozing off. This fear faded pretty quickly since my obvious blood clot was my biggest priority.

After those few days passed, my anxiety finally won the battle, and I went to the ER. Shocking news: I did not have a blood clot in my leg. I thought this confirmation would make me feel better, and it did for a few days. But my (mild, barely noticeable) leg pain persisted and after all my DVT research I decided I was among the extremely rare few who had an inaccurate ultrasound reading.

6 days after the first ER visit, I had an excruciating muscle spasm in my leg. Surely the blood clot has moved up into my thigh, I thought. This was accompanied by my lower back feeling like it was on fire and the fiery pain radiating down into my leg. My mom once again suggested a pinched nerve. I was in hysterics at this point so I ignored her and went back to the ER.

They did another ultrasound. It was negative. I had sciatica. Started googling that to make sure it could cause the symptoms I had (it can). The pain was goddamn miserable, but I wasn't going to die.

You'd think at this point I'd be good, but my mind had other plans. I developed a cough. Welp, the blood clot was real and must have traveled to my lungs. I'm dealing with a pulmonary embolism now and death is imminent. I believed this for a few days before finally accepting that it was fucking ridiculous.

So after about 3 weeks of this hell I finally moved on from my blood clot obsession and just focused on healing the sciatica. Had a nice 2 weeks or so of feeling like I was back to normal mentally, until this week.

I had a pain in my lower abdomen. Convinced myself it was a kidney infection. Didn't start off assuming a mostly harmless UTI (or literally any of the many other things that could cause abdominal pain), nah, I went right for the hard hitter. This one could kill me, it's gotta be that one. I considered appendicitis too.

It was constipation.

I was hopeful that my life would go back to normal after the whole blood clot disaster, but now I'm worried that it was just the beginning. I *knew* I was being ridiculous when I diagnosed myself with a kidney infection, but there was still that voice in the back of my head saying ""but what if..."". I was still researching, still getting worked up about it. I don't want to be like this. It's humiliating and exhausting.",1

"Rabies HA is wrecking me Hey all. So I've been struggling with HA for years now but was really doing a lot better, almost 3 months with no major scares or full on panic attacks or anything. Then a couple days ago I got hit like a ton of bricks. I haven't been able to focus on or accomplish anything for days now and could really use some perspective.

About three months ago I was bitten on the leg by a small dog while out on a run. It was a small bite, barely broke the skin, and it turned out to be my neighbor's dog. She was very understanding and even emailed me the dog's vaccination records. I also checked in last week and the dog is still alive and well.

Despite this, I started getting symptoms the other day and I cannot. Stop. Freaking. Out. I keep convincing myself I'm getting pain or tingling near the bite site, plus I have all my usual anxiety symptoms again (nausea, insomnia, loss of appetite, brain fog) which are all signs of rabies onset. I've done all the research, I know there's basically no chance of getting rabies from an animal that's still alive weeks later but nothing will put my mind at ease.

"My generic eye pain is totally an eye-eating parasite, right? Woke up this morning around 4am to my eye burning like hell, my eye was pouring tears and super sensitive to light, my vision was blurred, and my eyelids felt like they were coated in glass.

I got pissed, thinking I maybe had pink eye. Waited until 8am to go in to the doctor. By the time I did this, all that was left was a vague shred of soreness and light sensitivity- no more redness or crying. Doctor couldn't figure out what was wrong.

Cue my anxiety.

She put me on antibiotic eye drops, and told me to go to an ophthalmologist if it gets worse. 

Fast forward to this evening. The burning is back. Not as bad as before, but it's dull and present.

And now, I'm freaking out. Hyperventilating, sobbing, posting to reddit. Sounds dumb, I know. But I'm fucking terrified. My vision is everything to me and eye problems freak me out more than anything in the entire world.

I'll take a thousand nightmares of pregnancy scares and infections that'll kill me over this one. It honestly feels like my life is ending, ha.

"My worry of the week... Iâ€™ve been experiencing pain in my left shoulder for about a week. I do have an old injury on it and I sleep on that side mainly. On Friday the pain was so bad it had me in the ER twice. The last time with a shot of Demerol and a heavy duty muscle relaxer.

Iâ€™ve been drugged up most of the weekend, and for the most part the intense pain is gone but whatâ€™s left is a weak arm and numbness in my elbow and most of the fingers on my left hand. I see my doc tomorrow.

Itâ€™s likely a pinched nerve or tendinitis. The ER doc said my muscles were tight and the pain was intense spasms (Iâ€™m talking worse than childbirth-Iâ€™ve had two kids). 

Of course MY brain goes to worst case scenario like cancer and my body is riddled with tumours. The last couple days Iâ€™ve had what I think is heartburn and intermittent chest pain, which just fuels my cancer worry.

"Anyone else have a 'weird feeling' on the left side of their body? Like a sort of 'fullness' or that something is wrong. I've pretty much experienced this since I was an adolescent (I'm 21 now.) So basically, on the left side of my body, specifically the left breast, there is sometimes a benign feeling of 'fullness' and less commonly a dull sort of pain. It doesn't really radiate. Sometimes when it happens and flares up, I feel it the most when I breathe deeply in and out. I do have precordial catch syndrome (which is harmless), but I don't think that's what this is. I'm always convincing myself that it's angina and that I might have a heart attack, but then I remember I've had this feeling for *so long* in my life that I probably should have gotten one by now. Even when I was young, I had an EKG done and everything came back just fine, and a cardiologist I saw was totally convinced that nothing is wrong with me and just sent me on my way. I'm so sick of having this feeling and I don't know what to think of it. And just recently, I've started to have weird sensations on the left side of my left hand, and sometimes below my left breast. There is also a point in my left breast that when I touch and rub, it actually hurts. I'm thinking this may be a muscle strain or tear, but those things don't really last for several years, no?

To note: this feeling isn't constant, it comes and goes. Even when I forget about it, bam, it just comes out of nowhere.

I have no other symptoms. Zero breathing problems, no heartburn etc.",0
"Why do I keep creating problems in my head to get freaked out about? I've had this IRRATIONAL, above and beyond fear of skin cancer for like a year and a half now. I've had several moles, from the littlest freckle to big moles I've always had, that I obsess and get super paranoid about. I'm on mole #8 to freak out about. Part of this is because I still get a small mole/freckle (I'm 23) and I get super paranoid about getting a new one even though my derm tells me that this is normal. I just went to my derm about 3 weeks ago for my annual, there was a spot on my shoulder I was freaked about, ended being a black head, she checked all my other moles and said all was good. NOW, I'm onto two other spots that I am irrationally losing my mind about. I'm going to see my therapist a week from today so hopefully it will help. I just don't want to deal with this anymore.

"THIS is why I hate doctors... Iâ€™ve found there are two different types of health anxiety. 1. You seek out medical advice for any and all issues or 2. You avoid doctors and tests like the plague because youâ€™re scared of bad results. 

I am #2. 7 years ago, when I was 22, I had an OBGYN who badly needed clients bring me in 4x in a month unnecessarily to test me for slightly â€œabnormalâ€ results on various things. She told me I could have everything from kidney failure to cervical cancer and kept running test after test. 

Every visit she thought I was something else. I had no symptoms - this all started with amy first annual exam with her. I freaked out so bad that my parents were concerned about my mental well-being. 

I went to my family GP back home, who talked me off a cliff and re-tested me for everything. I was fine. 

Fast forward 7 years. Iâ€™m now pregnant. I havenâ€™t been to an OBGYN since that first doctor and am terrified. I was recommended a new OBGYN who was supposed to be really great. I go. I submit routine bloodwork, which was super scary for me due to previous experience. 

I get a call from new OBGYN telling me I tested positive for Hepatitis C, that it is chronic and incurable, and questioned about IV drug use. I run back in for follow up tests to tell me â€œhow bad I have it.â€

Follow up tests show that I do not in fact have Hepatitis C at all. Doctor had failed to tell me the false positive rate is up to 50%. (Oh, and per other doctors, it is curable if I even did have it. There are commercials on TV about said cure for crying out loud!)

Yâ€™all, I canâ€™t take this s*** anymore. I face my worst fear that I have a serious medical condition Iâ€™m unaware of, then Iâ€™m told theyâ€™ve found an underlying condition that could kill me, and then they TAKE IT ALL BACK.

I trust one doctor, and one doctor only. Thatâ€™s my GP and God help me when he retires. :*(",1

"Dealing with it I have been dealing with HA for the past 2-years. It is nice to realize I am not alone in my struggles. 

Currently have a rough bout with getting over the thought that I may have lung cancer. I am a non-smoker but I constantly am checking my phlegm to see if there is a little bit of blood. I do find very little bits some time but I am sure this is because of my obsessive checking.  Been to doctor and had an x-ray but these always seem like bandaids as the feeling comes back after weeks. 

I have been to a therapist and tried doing CBT but I find that my HA can quickly snowball if I do not nip it in the bud early on. Kind of where I feel I am at right now. 

Itâ€™s hard on my family and wife. She can tell when I am obsessing and if I talk to her she gets frustrated. Canâ€™t say I blame her I am pretty frustrated with myself. 

Donâ€™t know what I am expecting from this post but itâ€™s nice to be able to just put down some thoughts some where and get them off my chest. I do wonder if my experience echos those of others here, feel free to message me if you would like to chat.  ",0
"I had no idea so many people were like me. Ever since I was 15-16 I had panic attacks from thinking I was having a stroke or heart attacks or cancer etc. First was walking home from school started feeling very thirsty and hot then dizzy called 911 thinking I was dying/ having a heat stroke. Doc told me I had a panic attack. Now I'm 25 and been in and out of work due to my panic attacks or just the anxiety of having panic attacks. Im super depressed and have no drive to be the best me anymore. I feel stuck and like I'll never get better. Pot works wonders but unfortunately I don't live in a legal state. And since I'm looking for a job I can't use it I have to rely on my clonopin which only helps if I catch the panic attack in time. I get pains or find something wrong on my body and assume the worst instantly and go full panic mode. Fucking sucks. It's ruined my life, all I do now is put in job applications and play BFV to keep my mind off my body. Last income I've had was from a guy I used to work concrete construction with who hires me as a ranch hand ever so often but only for about a week a year. My father supports me but I hate relying on him because he barely makes any money doing what he does and we are always short on food because rent and utilities come first. I hate doing this to him.

"I think my HA is back I was doing well with my HA for the past year.

From my post history, you can see I had a small episode in December, I had a loss of feeling in my foot that lasted almost all month but I managed to stay chill (my friends freaked out more than I did, and that made me question if I am too chill, but overall I had no panic attacks or sleepless nights or anything). I went to a doctor after it lasted over 10 days and was sure it's just my back. I was prescribed some medicine for two weeks and got better, can feel my leg again. My doctor did schedule MRI for my back just to check why it happened, and since I have a sedentary job and have had minor back pain here and there, I was happy with that. MRI is next week. 

Now, this will get graphic. What is freaking me out right now is my bowel movements. I noticed that my BMs are a bit weird in August, I would get more constipated from time to time, feeling an incomplete evacuation from time to time, and I started to need to go more frequent (sometimes up to 4-5 times per day, usually I'd go 1-2 times per day). Since I was on my ""let's beat HA"" kick, I wrote it off to ""probably not eating as well as I should"" or ""maybe it's stress"". I had no pain or other issues and I had good BMs as well. 

Those symptoms did not go away, I got used to needing to go more often, got used to mild constipation mixed with occasional diarrhea but a month ago I noticed that I often would feel like I need to go but all that would come out would be a few thin pieces. And 10-15 minutes later I would feel like I need to go again. Then every 3-4 days I will get one somewhat bigger, normal-ish BM and would feel better (empty) for one day, then the cycle starts again. So for the last few months, and especially last month, I've had the following symptoms:

\- Change in the character or frequency of bowel movements

\- Thin, ribbon-like stools 

\- A sensation of incomplete evacuation after a bowel movement (almost all the time now),  persistent urge to have a bowel movement (also almost all the time)

\- Feeling back pain (could be unrelated, but it is low back pain)

\- Lately, lots of mucus

\- Lots of gas

\- Occasional rectal pain 

\- Very occasional blood (maybe once per two weeks or less)

My diet hasn't changed, I eat plenty of fiber, I don't eat meat or dairy. I know that as a 29-year-old, I should not be worried about colon cancer. I know my HA probably has made it something it's not. But I think what is freaking me out is not having a ""positive story"" for this. Like for my leg, I could tell myself ""it might be sciatic nerve, chill"", when my chest hurts, I know ""it's probably GERD"" etc. But I don't have a non-threatening explanation for these symptoms so I can feel my HA levels rising. Part of me is still clinging to ""this might be something else, you're fine"" but part of is ""you know what these symptoms mean, don't you"". 

I know that these symptoms are enough to go to a doctor, especially based on how long they have been there. Actually, I might have been stupid by not going to a doctor sooner. But I already have back MRI scheduled and I've been through so many bouts of HA, I know that as soon as my doctor will say something like ""let's get a colonoscopy"", I won't be able to sleep or eat at all. 

I don't really know what's the point of this post, since nobody can tell me what's wrong or what this could be, we're not doctors here and I should talk to mine. I guess I just needed to let it all out and know I am not alone and it fucking sucks to get HA back after a year of normal living. :(

About two weeks ago in central Alberta we were cleaning out a rental. I was sick already so just simply crashed on the mattress in the basement with the lights on.

"Hi Iâ€™m new - hypochondriac for 3 years. Hi everyone Iâ€™m 22 years old and have had bad health anxiety for years followed by depression.

Itâ€™s always something new each week, though the symptoms feels very much real and I am convinced there is something going on but Iâ€™m not sure what exactly.
Iâ€™ve had blood tests which show severe anaemia and low vit D.
These are my main health anxiety I experience a lot -

â€¢ Lymph nodes felt easily everywhere! For 2 years. Main one I worry about is below my right collarbone which is easily felt but moves very freely to the top of my collarbone. (Could probably feel 20 of them)
â€¢ Numb body parts that wake me up all the time - Neuropathy issues.
â€¢ Obsessed with not having thin stool/blood in stools.
â€¢ Pelvic Floor Tension.
â€¢ Spider veins
â€¢ Recurrent UTIs
â€¢ Random muscle aches.
â€¢ Specks in vision. (Vision getting worse fast)
â€¢ When I get the flu, itâ€™s not a normal â€œfluâ€ Iâ€™m in and out of hospital last time and my immune system catchâ€™s other viruses leaving my feeling like death for over a month (last time my whole right side of body was numb/weak)

Yeah my life has sucked the last 3-4 years. Iâ€™m also scared that thereâ€™s something really wrong with me.
Iâ€™m obsessed with googling every symptom - linking them all up together. I would try to find reassurance.. I would find an article to reassure me, then leave several pages open to just go back to them when Iâ€™m anxious again. Iâ€™d search and search til Iâ€™m on multiple pages of google.

"HA Person's Worst Nightmare, But I'm Coping A little about me: I'm vegan, fit, try to avoid processed foods, chemicals, only have monogamous relationships, never had a 1 night stand, etc. I have had health anxiety since I was 19 when I worked in an ER and saw all the terrible things that happen to people. 

So this past weekend I went to a college reunion with people I hadn't seen in 7 years. We went out one night and a friend asked if I smoked, I said no. He handed me his vape and said try this. I did, and hit it a few more times through out the night. 

Well at the end of the reunion weekend he revealed to a friend that he had been HIV+ for several years and currently has his virus controlled and undetectable. 

But needless to say it was a very stressful drive home. I had one of the worst HA freak outs I have had in years and didn't eat for 48 hours I was so nervous. I could hardly get out of bed!

Thankfully, I have been reassured that HIV is not passed via saliva -- even though I've what if'ed the hell out of the situation. Of course I will still test to confirm, but I learned so much about HIV in particular through this experience, which has helped mitigate my anxiety. ",1

"I got an aneurysm and i'm still alive I feel the need to add a trigger warning to this post. As someone who suffers from HA, I know this post can be scary but if I can be positive about it, you all can! I was diagnosed with brain aneurysm and artery dissections when I was 22, which put me at stroke risk until I was fully healed (which I am now). I will post the full story in the comments.

It seems that for some of you on here, that is literally your worst fear, I'm here to tell you that even if it does happen, an aneurysm or even a stroke is not a death sentence. In fact, I was healed (with no surgery) within 3 months.  The aneurysm had been there for at least 2 months before that and I had no idea, AND I STILL LIVED! The most debilitating part of this? The HA I got from it. It was the darkest 6 months of my life. I was in constant fear of having a stroke despite the blood thinners I was on. I never wanted to be alone anywhere and only felt truly safe with my parents. I had panic attacks all the time. But slowly, I gained more confidence in the functioning abilities of my body. I can honestly say that the HA affected me way more than the neurological symptoms did. So give your bodies more credit and your anxious brains less credit! 

If I can survive an aneurysm and torn artery and only have bits of HA after 2 years, so can you!!

These episodes last for well over 15 minutes and I never feel normal afterwards so I get annoyed when people label them as simple panic attacks, because they way other people describe there's, I feel as though mine are a lot different. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing to add, is over the summer I did acid for the first time, and I always read that acid will onset any mental illness you are going to get in the future. So I often fear that I did acid and fucked myself over because of it, but nobody on either side of the family has a history of schizophrenia or anything of the sort.

"flu season destroys me Hey everyone,

I have been a lurker for a while on this subreddit but I struggle so badly with HA, 

flu season is what does me in, I have emetephobia as well but flu season makes me agoraphobic at times.

Every single winter for the last three years I am burning my hands with sanitizer and if I hear I was near someone with the flu I will nearly throw up from a panic attack and sometimes panic so hard I am sweating and coming down with flu symptoms just from anxiety alone.

&amp;#x200B;

I do not understand why my fear of the flu is so intense, I have no idea how to make it less intense, and last years flu season was so scary I feel like I will never recover from the fear.

I was at the doctor today for a cough that won't quit and a sinus infection and somebody with the flu who tested positive was there....I am now nauseous with the thought i may get it.

Recently just moved to a new city for a new job, and I am all by myself in my apartment.  I don't have furniture yet and I am still sleeping in an air mattress right before I moved I had a muscle strain and the doctor prescribed me a short dose of prednisone.  I started to get real bad side effects at the end of the course and my blood pressure is shot up.  Went to the ER and was told not stress out and that it was just anxiety and the drug clearing my system.  My intial BP when they took it was 180/97 and thenback secs later dropped to 163/93I was thirsty and urinating all the time. I was convinced I had diabetes and high blood pressure.  All while moving to a new city &amp; new job.  Then began experiencing really bad heart issues coupled high blood pressure.  Tried to just relax but still stressing.

"I've never had an ulcer and can't remember the last time I had acid reflux. Upper stomach pain... brain says cancer, logic says acid reflux or ulcer. Help? Mostly asking what an ulcer really feels like.

 I've never had one before as far as I know (I'm 29) and have never been diagnosed with one. But then again, because of insurance issues, I've not really been able to see a doctor in like. Years. It's ridiculous. Long story. Anyway, I'm hoping to get insurance and be able to at least be seen within the next few months. Until then, though, reassurance is kind of all I can get.

I know what that sharp burning acid reflux feels like, I used to get it sometimes in high school, but generally, I don't ever experience that. I honestly can't remember the last time I got that sickly, burning acid reflux feeling. My diet's really bland out of preference (mostly vegetarian / some, but not a lot of meat) which I think contributes to a lot of my inexperience with acid reflux.

I have pain in my upper abdomen, right in the middle. I can't tell if I'm feeling it in my esophagus, liver or upper stomach.  It feels very close to the surface and hurts when I push on it. It doesn't really feel like the way acid does when it trickles up into the esophagus. The pain worsens when I have gas and eases up when that passes. It's dull and honestly easy enough to just work through, but the fact that I've been having it almost every day for a couple of weeks now concerns me.

Doesn't hurt to breathe. Just this dull ache ranging from annoying to actually kind of ouch, but still not enough to vocalise about. Just concerning because it keeps happening.

I used to drink a couple beers every night but now have since eliminated that to see if it makes a difference (I can't tell if it helps. Feels the same as when I drank every night.) 

Is it possible that this is just acid reflux and that it can feel different from the hot burning feeling in the heart area?

Does this sound more like an ulcer?

For what it's worth, I think I'm in fairly good healthâ€”just underweight (95lbs, 5'4"", Female) with no family history of cancer (but I recently learned I have a family history of gall bladder problems.) Mildly sedentary activity levels (work a desk job and tend to spend a lot of time writing at my computer while at home.)

Any advice to tide me over until insurance comes through would rock. Thank you so much for reading.",0

"This has become devastating. m(24)So. Iâ€™ve always been a worrier. Worried about everything since I was little. Iâ€™ve struggled with OCD, and anxious thoughts for a long time. However, it seems that since a ER visit in the summer, Iâ€™ve been super aware of aches and pains more than I have in the past. It had led me down a road of constant deliberations on my own health. I have dealt with chest pain, lower-extremity pain, and seemingly much more. 

December was a rough month for me. A lot of stress about jobs and life changes. However, it seemed my health anxiety became insane. Heartburn ruined my Christmas. I have become so anxious. 

However, I am seemingly now facing my biggest challenge yet. For about a week now, possibly two. I have felt a small fluttering in my right abdomen. I have also been bloated and am constipated. I think itâ€™s important to mention, I am not the best eater. Missing meals, not eating enough, eating one large meal a day, reliance on cereal. However, I went to see the doctor and she had said it was constipation. She prescribed some glyencol and said to up my fiber, and improve my diet. However, my intestines in the last three days have begun to contract or spasm. Almost like waves reverberating inside me. Itâ€™s not entirely stopping me from living, but itâ€™s simply awful to feel. So now I fear the worst. I just want to live my life. The saddest part about HA is the fear that something could be wrong. I just needed to vent. This subreddit has been helpful. Thank you. ",1

"I am literally at my breaking point. I seriously donâ€™t know what to do or even where to begin with all of this. Please bear with me, I know Iâ€™m likely going to be all over the place. 

Ok, for starters I am a 38 year old female with a pretty lengthy history of health anxiety, regular anxiety - if itâ€™s anxiety related, I probably suffer from it. I worry about EVERYTHING. Itâ€™s as if I just get a simple thought in my head I have to run with it to the extreme. I have had every disease imaginable. MS, multiple types of cancer, the list could go on forever.... 

I see a psychiatric NP who has tried to put me on some different medication, which I cannot take. Once I read the side effects forget it. All bets are off and I just suffer. I do take a low dose of Xanax, which helps me in the midst of a really bad time, but I havenâ€™t taken anything long term. Iâ€™ve seen therapists in the past and to be honest they were not that helpful. I assume just not the right fit or whatnot. 

Usually when my HA hits it will last for a couple of weeks or so and then I get over whatever my problem is at that time. Iâ€™ll do ok for a while and then itâ€™ll dawn on me that, wow, Iâ€™ve been feeling pretty good lately! Thatâ€™s when my brain is like â€œhere, hold my beerâ€. Then all fucking hell breaks loose... which leads me to today. 

Iâ€™ve been having stomach issues for a while now.  A variety of symptoms that are all over the place. I went to my GP who did bloodwork. According to them, it was normal. I saw a gastroenterologist yesterday who isnâ€™t overly concerned, but weâ€™re doing an ultrasound and an endoscopy to just rule stuff out. Great. 

When I was at my GP appointment she asked me a bunch of questions. Blood in stool? No. Night sweats? No..... Wait, after I thought about this I realized I DO get night sweats sometimes. Itâ€™s not all the time, but itâ€™s definitely happened a handful of times that I can remember. Like pretty bad too. Of course I didnâ€™t tell her this because by the time I remembered I was long gone. What could night sweats possibly mean? Donâ€™t worry - Dr. Google to the rescue. Lymphoma, leukemia?! Wtf. Now Iâ€™m losing my mind with worry. 

Next up. I have this weird hard area in my mouth. Looks like a mandibular tori. Of course Iâ€™m freaking out about this too. I go to the dentist religiously and Iâ€™m going to call them Monday morning just to make sure but in the meantime Iâ€™m seriously losing it.

Iâ€™m so concerned about my mental health. I need help. The only good thing about any of this is... I took half a pill of the lexapro I was prescribed that has been sitting on my nightstand for the last 6 months. I know itâ€™s not doing anything right now, but I at least took it which is a huge step for me. 

All I can do is hope for peace and try to find a way to enjoy my life. I want to live! I am just debilitated and heated down by my anxiety. If it even is anxiety and not some terrible disease after all. 

Honestly, I just want to know Iâ€™m not alone in the way I feel. And I feel completely and utterly alone. Nobody understands. If you suffer from HA, or my ridiculous story is at all relatable to you, please by all means I would love to hear what you have to say. I just want to feel better. Thanks ",1
"How do get over mild hearing loss in right ear? I've been crying and depressed. I've had health anxiety for a long time, but none of my fears have come true until now. It all started when I saw a video of tinnitus sufferers getting a temporary relief. I had no idea what tinnitus was so I googled it. Turns out I have a mild form of that and hearing things when it's quiet is not normal, it's tinnitus. I was shocked since I've had that ALL my life. I remember hearing the ""sound of silence"" AKA the ringing in my ears since I was very young. I was really shocked and scared at that time, since I never noticed this before. But that's not the peak of my misery. I read that tinnitus is often accompanied with hearing loss in any way. I then did countless online tests and always came back with the top score. 

However, I found an app that makes an audiogram of separate ears and how much hearing loss you have in them. I got my results and they said I had mild hearing loss in my right ear in the mid-range frequencies (but not the higher ones). I didn't think much of it at first until I tried blocking each ear individually to see if there was any difference in hearing and now I can hear a magnificent difference. My right hear is more muffled when I block out my left ear and my left ear sounds perfect.

How do I get over this? I got out of my depressive state around 6 months ago and have been doing so good since.. until I noticed all of this. I don't feel normal. I feel like I'm handicapped now and PERMANENTLY. This word is what makes all this so scary.. permanent. Means that I will NEVER hear normally in the right ear and this devastates me. Might devastate me more than the average person since I make music and music used to be a big part of my coping mechanism with depression. Please help how I can get over this, I can't accept that I have hearing loss even though it's mild. I don't know what to do. I can't afford a counselor and I don't want to tell my parents about this. I feel suicidal.",1

"Terrified of 'Venous Leak' Hello,

I'm turning 21 in April and I've struggled with health anxiety for past 3 and a half years. Recently I've been getting better and even managed to get myself into a relationahip which was great.

The thing is, two weeks ago I noticed that I seem to struggle with getting/keeping erections. So I obviously started Googling, which was not helpful(as always)  as it said its mostly thing old guys get and so on. What it did notice was a terrifying thing called Venous Leak, which means your veins can't trap blood for erection, there is no fix for that and you're doomed. So I started stressing over this so badly, I wanted to know everything about it, thing is, out of all my health scares, I never seen a condition so poorly reported, there is very little information about it and no statistics and contradicting facts, which is fueling my anxiety even more. 

So I'm sitting here worrying that surely I must have it and seeing it seems to be very unknown I definitely have it. Has anyone heard or knows more about this?

"Booked a health test - total regression Hi,
I've experienced health anxiety on and off for most of my life. It has become a lot better over the years and I have found ways to cope and calm myself down. I'm not the HA-type that goes to doctors a lot - actually almost never - partly because my ""rational"" part knows that it's just HA and partly because it's so crazy expensive. My main tools for managing HA has been ""act normal"" (even if I feel worried and obsess, do not take action - don't look for reassurance, don't see a doctor, don't google - don't feed the monster), setting a specific time when it's ok to worry (""between 6-7 at night, worry time. At other times, just postpone it."") and writing down what I worry about. It's been going well for the last few years and I almost considered myself ""cured"".
Until I decided to go for an extensive health check with a battery of tests. There's no particular symptom that brought on this, just that it's something I should start doing regularly at my age. What normal people do. However, as soon as I booked the test and got the list of tests, HA totally exploded. In a way worse than the usual HA where I used to focus on just a few illnesses - now I basically convinced that with that many tests and possible cancers, I must check positive for at least one! Has anyone else experience this kind of setback and how did you cope? I still have two-three more weeks before the results.",1
"Having a bit of a health scare right now, could use some help making sure this doesn't spiral out of control. Hi everyone, new here, but could use some help.

I am a 27 year old male.  I have a history of health anxiety/hypochondria and I also have an undiagnosed chronic inflammatory pain condition.  I also have GERD and barrett's esophagus.

I stopped taking the prilosec I was taking for my GERD and also haven't been to a doctor in about 4 or 5 years to get an endoscopy.  For those of you who don't know Barrett's Esophagus is a precancerous condition.   This is also where the concern comes in.

I drink pretty heavily, not everyday, but definitely on weekends, and I also smoke socially.

Leading up to New Year's I started noticing that I could feel liquids going down into my stomach a little more than usual.  This was a little alarming, then my GERD started getting worse.  Then I started having problems swallowing and then I completely lost my appetite.  I've been struggling with appetite loss and swallowing problems for a couple weeks now.

Now when you google the symptoms these are all common symptoms of Esophageal cancer.  This is where the fun has begun.  I don't know where the cycle started, but I am thoroughly convinced I have cancer at this point.  

I've made a doctor's appointment to my primary, and asked for a referral to a Gastroenterologist.   Gastroenterologist office says they are ""reviewing my file"" so I can't make an appointment yet. This concerns me, dont want to jump through hoops because part of my file is missing. 

In the meantime, I'm just trying to get through the days.  Super hungry, but zero appetite so I've been forcing myself to eat which is awful.   But I also feel like I've been worrying myself to death thinking it's cancer and spending time on my phone ""researching"".  

What can I do?  Tonight I was going to take a xanax, turn my phone off and watch a movie to try and calm myself down, but I didn't end up doing that.  I just ended up looking at more esophageal cancer stuff.  

How do I stop worrying about this until I get my doctor appointments.  It might be a month or two at this rate before I get an endoscopy!  ",1

"Lymph node just...gone? 21M, Iâ€™ve been worried about lymphoma for over a year now. I had a lump in my armpit that I didnâ€™t know if it was a lymph node/cyst/muscle/nothing at all for over a year. It never grew, changed, anything. I check it from time to time and get anxious once in a while, but have gotten it relatively under control (the anxiety). 

Anyways, I go to the gym today like any other normal day, come home to shower and itâ€™s....not there? I cracked my shoulder at the gym but nothing else out of the ordinary (I did work shoulders) and itâ€™s just not sticking out like it did, and Iâ€™m thoroughly confused and quite honestly anxious for no reason at all. I have been dealing with a shoulder injury for as long as I can remember as well. 

Where did it go? Was it not a lymph node then? Itâ€™s still the slightest bit asymmetrical from my right armpit, but not like usual. Was it likely not even a lymph node then? 

Iâ€™ve been told that if it remained unchanged for so long (14 months from noticing it) that itâ€™s either unlikely a lymph node or just a shotty one. Itâ€™s rare that lymphoma would leave the same node unchanged for such a long time I was told. ",1

"hantavirus?!? hello fellow reddit people. i go over to my boyfriends every weekend and i think it was the 29th of december when i went to start packing, i opened the dresser and seen that the mice chewed through some wood and shit everywhere. one shirt had a massive pile of crap and wood shavings on it and got all through my clothes. so i just started taking them all out except for the one shirt that had the most droppings. i havenâ€™t open the closet till i needed a shirt tuesday, put it on and forgot about the mice poop but i didnâ€™t think much of it. i got really bummed thinking about how pretty much all my clothes were destroyed with mice feces and urine (iâ€™ll admit i let them go for about a week). so last night i put gloves on and put all my clothes in trash bags. i threw away the shirt that had the main crap on it. then i started vacuuming out my drawers with a shirt tied around my neck cause i was scared to breathe it in. then of course i got online and started reading about the virus and began to go into panic mode.  i read that if you vacuumed the poop up it can become airborne but i didnâ€™t worry about that until after i started overthinking. i slept two hours because i was so terrified that i was gonna die in my sleep. this morning i got so frightened with getting the â€˜hantavirusâ€™ that i immediately went to the ER and they took my blood, urine and an EKG. the tests came back fine turns out iâ€™m just dehydrated. yet my anxiety still is causing me to freak out and constantly thing i have the virus. iâ€™m scared to death (literally). my anxiety is making me think also that they misdiagnosed me which happens a lot with this disease. my boyfriend and many people have reassured me that iâ€™m okay and that i didnâ€™t get the virus yet idk if itâ€™s my anxiety mimicking the symptoms of the virus or what but iâ€™m very positive that i will be dead soon. i just need some opinions from strangers i guess?",1

"Rabies HA is driving me batty Hi fellow anxiety sufferers

&amp;#x200B;

I've been good for months but my HA has decided to welcome the new year with a flare up. A few nights ago I was reading in my bedroom with the window open, when I heard some rustling/flapping at the curtain. I went to take a look and couldn't see anything except for two large geckos. I guess they could have been chasing each other on the curtain, causing the rustling, but who knows.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I went back to the bed and was facing away from the window with my hand resting behind my head, when I felt a sharp sensation in one of my fingers. I looked around and couldn't see anything, and there were no puncture wounds or marks on my hand.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story kinda short, I've convinced myself that a rabid bat flew into my room, snuck up on me, nipped my finger and then ninja'ed itself away â€“ this despite there being no actual sighting of a bat or any wound.

&amp;#x200B;

I realise how irrational and ridiculous this all sounds, but nonetheless, the fear of dying from rabies is real and it's driving me a little nutty. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just to mention that I don't live in a rabies hot spot, the incidence of rabies in humans from bat bites in my country is very low, and apparently fewer than 0.5% of the bat population is rabid. So...

&amp;#x200B;

I really just want to go get some rabies shots but I reckon my doctor will think I'm nuts. Any advice on how to deal with this anxiety or any words to help put my mind at ease would be much appreciated!",1
"I hate myself for drinking. I don't know why I always do this to myself, I lie to myself and say a couple beers won't hurt me later on, well here I am later on anxious as fuck and ready to jump out of my own skin. Chest tightness, palpitations, feelings of disconnection, shortness of breath, this inescapable fear that my heart is gonna stop and I'll drop dead, oh and currently my hands are going numb/cold so that's just fucking lovely, it's like my anxiety is searching for new symptoms to manifest right now. I hate myself. I feel stupid for doing this again.",1
"Anxiety or actually ill? So I don't know where to start this so I'm just gonna get to the point. I'm an otherwise healthy 20 y/o female and last week my legs started feeling very itchy. Then, the itching moved upwards to my torso and arms. On wednesday I noticed two strange rashes on my arms and decided to see a doctor because the itching was just horrible. He said it's probably an allergy and that he can't do much until i figure out at least if it's food or something enviromental causing the problem, and he gave me allergy pills to ease my itching and rashes. He said to take two if the rashes reappear. So the next day, when I got another one on my arm, I took just one pill, and they stopped appearing. The next day, I took one more just to be sure and the itching and rashes were totally gone by friday. Now, the problem is, on friday I thought my breathing was a bit more labored than usual. It's probably all in my brain but the feeling hasn't gone away. If I put my mind to something else, I'm fine, but as soon as I start thinking about it, I get panicky. It's been the same for 4 days now, and I'm not sure what to do about it. Also, on friday, when I had lunch I ate very little until I started feeling very sick. The same on saturday and sunday. Is it all due to my anxiety? I'm nervous to see a doctor because I don't want him to think I'm making stuff up, because I was just at his office a few days ago, and now I'd show up with another problem. Helppp",1
"Squeezing feeling in my ribs Hey guys. Really glad I found this sub - seems really helpful! Was just wondering if anybody experiences a similar symptom to what I have a lot of the time.

Most of the time my body feels okay? Okay enough, I guess. But once every 2/3 days I seem to get symptoms in and around my ribcage area. That entire section of my body suddenly feels very tense, and it gives me added symptoms too. When I stand up I get more lightheaded, my breathing because shallower by default, my heart races, and I sweat a ton. I also feel like there's a general squeezing action occuring around my ribcage. For example,  when I take certain breaths I can physically feel the tension in my rib area. Because this area is so close to my heart, I worry that it is actually my heart malfunctioning. I hope that isn't the case and it's more to do with my ribcage area being tense or something.

The weird thing is that most of the time when this symptom comes along I'm not even nervous. It just always seems to happen in the evening when I'm watching the TV, or having just been for a walk.

What makes it worse is that it doesn't leave either. The only way I can make it stop is by going to sleep and then my body 'resetting' to normal the next morning. Sex can help the issue, but other times it makes it worse too. My body just feels full of adrenaline when the symptom start.

So I was just wondering if anybody had anything similar? I just don't understand the source of it all. I'm rarely anxious mentally beforehand, but it seems as if my body is anxious. It just comes on so randomly. The problem is that from there on the symptoms it gives me are so uncomfortable that I worry about it. It makes me wonder if I have a heart problem or something along those lines. Is it just all an internal anxiety attack built up from all of the tension my anxiety disorder in general gives me? Is it some sort of adrenaline problem? I don't know but I desperately want to solve it because it hinders my functionality so much. I just turn into a breathless, tense mess when it hits me, and it causes me so much distress. ",1

"Diabetes Anxiety Helloo everyone, Iâ€™m new here I could really use someones advice im kind of freaking out, I havenâ€™t been diagnosed with diabetes, but Iâ€™m really scared that I have it and I know the smartest thing to do is to make an appt with your doctor so I did but my doctor is out for a couple weeks, so my appt isnâ€™t until feb. So a little about me I have been diagnosed with Anxiety, and Iâ€™m known to overreact, but I canâ€™t get myself to calm down. Iâ€™m always scared that I have diabetes because I am over weight Iâ€™m like 50-60 pounds overweight Iâ€™m only 19 years old, and I know I need to lose weight and get healthy itâ€™s really hard for me and my weight is something that I really struggle with. So with that being said diabetes has always been in the back of my mind and some days it creeps up and takes over me and Iâ€™m freaking out about it the whole day. Today is worse because I learned about something called DKA I donâ€™t know much about it but what I did read about it is making me scared, usually when I have anxiety Iâ€™ll take a nap or something now I donâ€™t even want to do that after reading something about it. Iâ€™m not really always thirsty all the time, I usually have to force myself to drink water. I sometimes feel like I pee a lot but I wake up when Iâ€™m sleeping to pee except for when I wake up in the morning I always have to pee, and before I go to bed I get up 2-3x to pee. Sometimes I feel like my feet and toes are tingly like if there falling asleep and then it will go away, as for blurry vision my vision is bad to begin with, Iâ€™m also always on my phone which probably dosenâ€™t help. I havenâ€™t had any significant amount of weight loss, if anything Iâ€™ve gained more weight. I also keep watch when I get a scratch or a cut and I just had one on my leg about 2 weeks ago and it healed fine. Iâ€™m also TIRED all the time, I get super super tired sometimes I take a nap and sometimes I try to fight it out until the itâ€™s time to sleep at night this could be because my sleep pattern is all over the place and Iâ€™m currently trying to get it back on track but I donâ€™t know. I know I probably sound dumb, and I know you guys canâ€™t diagnose me but maybe if someone could just help me out, ease my mind, or let let me know what they think, I should probably get off the internet and relax but I canâ€™t, always this was just what I am thinking right now so if something I said about anything in here is false regarding the symptoms or the whole DKA thing I do apologize, also sorry for making this so long.

"Muscle Weakness from Anxiety? Hello all! This is a wordy post but I really need some input on this.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a heaping helping of OCD and GAD. Since last summer I have been going through a huge amount of stress from changing medications and not yet having found the right combination, all while working full time with ADHD. I also started taking blood pressure medication because that's just how my body responds to antidepressants/I have bad genes, clearly.

&amp;#x200B;

Two months ago, I started having full body muscle weakness. I don't necessarily feel it all the time, although I am a lot more prone to soreness now. But any time I try to do anything physical (climbing stairs, washing dishes, actual exercise) my muscles start getting fatigued and that ""burning"" sensation that comes with a lot of activity. I feel like I have about a third of the stamina I usually do (and my baseline stamina isn't great), and I'll feel like I've done a long workout after basically nothing. I have always had a tendency to muscle stiffness but never experienced anything like this. 

&amp;#x200B;

My doctor has run a bunch of tests and there's absolutely no medical reason she can find for this. This started a few weeks after I started a blood pressure medication that worked, but my blood pressure is not low and she cannot find any electrolyte imbalance/anything else that might be caused by it. Neither my PCP nor psychiatrist have ever heard of a side effect like this for any of the medications I'm on.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is, have any of you ever heard of or experienced muscle weakness like I'm describing as a side effect of stress/anxiety? I definitely have had physical illnesses from anxiety before (pain, dizziness, nausea) but this is new. I wouldn't be surprised if this was from the stress of the past few months, but I really can't say. Any input would be very appreciated!",1

I have a small red bump right next to it too which is kinda irritated, but the ""big"" one is the one that freaks me out the most. When I fully open my legs you can see a bit of protrusion.

"Proud of Myself Hi everyone! It's been a while since I posted on this sub and I really wanted to share a small success story to hopefully help you if you need it.

So this past summer I was active on here all the time. I was convinced I had a brain tumour, bone cancer, blood clots, and a bunch of other issues. 

I ended up starting therapy in September and it's been going great! I've been able to stop immediately seeking reassurance (i.e. going to the ER) and dealing with my fear of death. I still struggle with googling and the initial worry of symptoms, but I can honestly say I'm starting to get better.

Anyways, I feel like I had a major milestone today - even if it doesn't really seem like that big of a deal. 

My health anxiety is mostly focused on myself, but also extends to other people I care about, like my family. So naturally, when my mom told me she found a large lump on her breast while showering, I panicked. Like full blown panic. I immediately thought the worst (shocker), especially because just two months ago she'd gotten called back for an abnormal mammogram and had to do a bunch of imaging tests to make sure it was nothing terrible. That week waiting for results was excruciating (thankfully it was just benign cysts). Naturally, this brought me back to that terrible week of worry, and I was immediately thinking that, despite 2 mammograms + an ultrasound not even two full months ago, that the doctors must have missed something and that she had a terrible disease.

My initial instinct was to google - I tend to seek out information in times of stress because it helps me feel like I have some control over the situation. I was so tempted to google incidence rates of breast cancer, likelihood of breasts cyst vs. cancer, and the like. I had intentions of reassuring myself, but I also knew that doing that would only feed into my anxiety and make it worse. Despite how badly I wanted to do research, I forced myself to ignore the compulsion. I was also able to rationalize and talk through my fears to come up with a logical conclusion (i.e. family history of cystic breasts = likelihood of cyst vs. cancer)

Thankfully, our family doctor believes that it's just a cyst that was seen on the mammogram, but filled with fluid due to her upcoming period. He's sending her for an ultrasound to be safe, but overall isn't worried.

However, despite all this, I feel really proud of myself! I managed to avoid Googling because I knew it would harm me, even if I was convinced it would help me. I really feel like I accomplished something, and I hope that sharing this encourages any of you who need help to get it. Therapy has been a godsend for me, even if it's just in small steps like this.",1
"Have you experienced death? Iâ€™m just curious. I am a 30yo female and I have had anxiety, and health-specific anxiety, since I was about 14.

"My story of HIV anxiety Hi there,

For the last month and a half I've been dealing with the worst health anxiety of my life. Prior to this my health anxiety has been me thinking i'm going to have a heart attack causing me to constantly check my pulse. Things along those lines. But my current situation is far more severe. Here it is, I've posted something on here before about it.

I met a girl and we talked for months. She is a sexual person and I am not, it took me months before I finally decided I could move past just talking. After sex with a condom the first few times, we had unprotected sex the next a few times. I know how stupid this is but its even more idiotic for someone with health anxiety as i've learned. We agreed it was okay to do because i had no sexual history and she had been tested negative for stds. After the last time, 2 weeks later i got very sick. My doctor called it the worst sore throat she had seen in a long time. Along with that came chills, body aches, fatigue. I had blood work done my doctor called to say I had mono. I had only kissed this one person, and I asked her she said she had mono 4 years before. 

However, I idiotically googled symptoms. As it turns out, HIV in its early stages has all the symptoms of mono. Combine that with having unprotected sex 2 weeks before feeling sick and immediately I become overwhelmed with fear. I began to notice other things wrong with my body that resembled acute HIV - my tongue has a coating on it that i think is oral thrush, a rush formed on my chest after i started to feel better. Other things started to appear like my stomach began to growl regularly and my legs turn red in the shower. This fear hasn't gone away for a month now to the point of it keeping me up at night and sporadic panic attacks when I think about it throughout the day.

I have to take a test to put this to rest and resolve it. I know how extremely unlikely it would be for me to have this. I asked if she had been tested for stds since and she said she had been very recently. On top of this, im not sure i can ever be intimate or sexual again if this is how im going to act. ",1

"Some very helpful words to put things in perspective This is an article I found that makes me feel profoundly better every time I read it. I posted it as a comment a few weeks ago, but I thought it might reach/help more people as its own post. It seems relevant to some recent posts on this sub. I'll post the url in the comments, but here it is:



""We all worry about our health from time to time, at least to some degree, but some people worry excessively about catastrophic consequences of seemingly benign symptoms. Theyâ€™re known as hypochondriacs.

This is the sort of process hypochondriacs go through: whatâ€™s that? A benign lump or malignant bump on your face, breast or rump? Adrenaline rush, heart pumping, sweating, and light-headedness follow, confirming the gravity of the terminal self-diagnosis.

Thoughts racing and images of a foreshortened future, orphaned children, and opportunities missed. Overwhelming distress. Must plan the epitaph â€“ see, I told you I was sick!

Our future and physical health are inherently uncertain. But people with hypochondriasis immediately resolve any uncertainty about novel physical sensations and symptoms on the side of catastrophe.

The body is constantly in a state of flux. The heart pumps, blood flows, muscles twitch, lungs inflate, and bowels contract. Strange symptoms come and go. And most pass without conscious awareness as we focus on daily tasks.

But try this. Hold your hand upwards, so that your palm and fingertips face the sky. Focus all your attention on the tips of your fingers and wait â€¦and wait â€¦until you notice some sensations. Tingling, temperature changes, or just an awareness of the sensations on your skin.

Hereâ€™s an even simpler task. As you read this, shift your attention on to the sensations of the ground or chair pushing up against your body. Chances are you were unaware of all these sensations just moments ago.

Attention, you see, is the microscope of the mind. It can filter in or out any of your internal or external experiences.

Now imagine becoming hypervigilant to all the physical changes naturally occurring in your body. Try it. Just focus on all the sensations in your body for a minute. Amazing, isnâ€™t it? Itchy toes, tense jaw, mild headache, numbness, and so on. All the normal workings of a healthy body.

People with somatic symptom disorder are experts at searching for and noticing normal bodily changes. Theyâ€™re also experts at interpreting these in potentially catastrophic ways â€“ fatigue is leukemia; a lump on the arm is cancer.

The number one enemy of someone with the disorder is Dr Google (â€œcyberchondriaâ€). Indeed, the only thing more catastrophically creative than a hypochondriacâ€™s mind is Googleâ€™s 2.42 million webpages on the causes of cancer. Every possible symptom can be linked to every possible diagnosis, by at least one disreputable source or another.

The hypochondriac is searching not for information, but for confirmation of their imminent demise. If theyâ€™re unlucky, they might come across contradictory information or additional ailments they hadnâ€™t yet considered.
Their intense worry and anxiety feel intolerable and must be neutralised. Seeking out a sympathetic doctor or other source of reassurance, or avoiding the health section of the newspaper all provide temporary relief until the next physical symptom is perceived.

So what are some things that keep hypochondriacs worrying?

Belief: worrying will help me catch something early.

No, it wonâ€™t. Worrying will just keep you miserable until youâ€™re old enough to find out how you will shuffle off this mortal coil (unless, of course, your demise is a blissfully brief surprise). Worry itself will not get you any closer to predicting, preventing, or planning for your death.

Belief: I can get certainty about my health.

Nope, canâ€™t get that either. No amount of checking, doctor visits, Googling, reassurance-seeking will guarantee with 100% certainty that youâ€™re well. I can, however, guarantee that the unrelenting pursuit of certainty will make you miserable.

So, how can you manage health anxiety?
First, develop some healthy guidelines for monitoring your health and stick to them.
Based on your past experience, how long do benign symptoms typically last? One day, two days, one week? Decide how long you will wait before seeking any form of certainty or reassurance (from the internet, friends, family, or medical practitioners) the next time you notice a symptom, especially ones youâ€™ve worried about in the past. Once this time expires (no pun intended), make a decision about whether you need to get the symptom checked or whether you can wait another little while before doing so. Follow guidelines from reputable sources about the recommended frequency of body checking.

And, be willing to sit with uncertainty about your health. None of us ever have certainty about our health. I could have a brain tumour as I write these words. I am willing to accept this possibility and shift my attention onto the next paragraph.

Think about it this way: if I offered you a $2 million insurance policy for your house, even if I promised to build you a gold-plated replacement if it were destroyed, you would likely consider it far too expensive.

So, how much are you willing to pay to prevent any possibility of illness? Are you willing to give up your capacity to work, time you would otherwise spend with friends and family, and ultimately your happiness? This is a very high price to pay.

Spend energy on things you truly value, rather than wasting it on a false insurance policy. Learn to accept uncertainty about your health. Revel in not knowing when or how the end will come. Focus instead on the time between now and then.

Ultimately, what you have to decide is which epitaph you would prefer when your inevitable end arrives: â€œlived decades in misery and fear of deathâ€, or â€œdidnâ€™t see that coming but my life was far richer for it.â€",1
"Worried about salivary gland cancer So iâ€™m 24 year old male. Iâ€™ve had a swollen salivary gland (2,5cmx2cm?) right below my left ear ) for a couple of years. Iâ€™ve visited couple doctors in these past years, i have had an ultrasound done ,a couple times and a MRI. Doctors keep saying everything is normal.

 Iâ€™m not sure if it has grown, but the size has stayed the same for at least 6 months i think?

"Dizzy after cruise Hey everyone,

Iâ€™ve been on this site for a while now, and I wanted post a question.

I got back 9 days ago from a 7 day cruise. It was wonderful! No anxiety, I felt like me again :)

However, since returning, Iâ€™ve been swaying and feeling dizzy when walking. I keep telling myself that itâ€™s from the cruise, but itâ€™s been 9 days!

I donâ€™t seem to feel it when driving or anything else, but mostly when standing or walking.

"When can we celebrate victory and rejoice? 26M. Met my first panic attack mid-August 2018. The next five month that followed were hard and you all know how it feels.

I do remember there was a period in October and November when anxiety went away. I was happy, but happy too early, it came back knocking on my brainâ€™s door last month. I do remember the frustration I felt because of that.

The most recent anxiety episode was on the 4th of January. Iâ€™ve been feeling well for almost 2 weeks now. I do get anxiety-typical bodily symptoms, but I have been better at ignoring or noticing very little of that.

"Swollen lymph node, goes away as fast as it inflames \*\*Repost from AskDocs

As far as i remember, this began this past summer. One of my armpits would get a painful feeling, almost as if I pulled a muscle or so, but no lump or anything. Then a couple of days later, it would be painful and a lump and what I figure to be a lymph node. It's never more than 1 inflamed at a time under 1 armpit. It used to be just the left, but this morning I woke up with one under my right. I would say the frequency is about 1 flare up every 2 to 4 weeks, moreso on the side of a month. And no bigger than a pea, or maybe M&amp;M. I can't really tell since I touch it, but sometimes the skin appears reddish underneath, sometimes it doesn't. They eventually go down again and no pain and it feels fine. I don't ever have any symptoms of being sick, as in cough, fever, chills, etc. Everything is pretty normal beside the lymph node (if it is that) flaring up. So, something more serious to worry about and go see my PC or just let it be? Could they be cysts that flare up and then go back down? It's not the same lump either, the location changes too. I do have history of healthy anxiety (my fear is lymphoma) and i've been to the doc plenty of times this past year already and would rather not for something like this, especially when it goes away.

I should mention, not sure if this matters, but I had changed deodorants around the same time frame, from deo/antiperspirant to just a deodorant. Anyone got an idea?",1

"Feeling of trapped burp/excessive burping/Nausea Hello all, lately Iâ€™ve been going through a scare as someone with IBS. Lately Iâ€™ve been excessively burping. Even if I havenâ€™t eaten anything yet, and especially once I eat something. However, the thing is sometimes I need to force the burp out because it feels like itâ€™s trapped in my stomach or chest or throat. And when Iâ€™m unable to get the burp out, it makes me feel nauseous. For the past couple of days except yesterday, Iâ€™ve been either dry heaving or actually vomiting. When I vomit, itâ€™s either this clear liquid that tastes like acid, which I assume is acid, and sometimes itâ€™s food I eat. Burping helps relieve the feeling for a few minutes but then itâ€™s back. This has been happening for a couple of weeks already. But before, I wasnâ€™t diagnosed with IBS. I had HA about colon cancer. Once I was told that it was IBS by my GI, the burping never stopped but the nausea sort of did.

Fast forward a little bit, and I was fine. I was eating healthier and my bowel movements were even improving. I even went on a trip to Hawaii and I was fine there. I had one bout of nausea but thatâ€™s it. And then shit hit the fan right when I got back from Hawaii. Basically whatever I said in the beginning lol. But hereâ€™s a list of all my symptoms/medical issues:

-Excessive burping
-feeling like a burp is trapped in stomach/chest/throat
-Nausea (due to reason above)
-Occasional acid when I burp and in the morning when I wake up (making me think itâ€™s possibly GERD but I donâ€™t have heartburn and this feeling is only occasional)
-dry heaving/vomiting clear liquid/food. No red blood or coffee grounds or green or yellow liquid.
-mild IBS, no abdominal pain, predominantly constipation (although it has been getting better. Iâ€™ve been having nice BM every day. But yesterday it was diarrhea which is weird)
-sometimes blood on the toilet paper, but this always happens when I have to strain and it hurts and itches. GI says I have internal hemorrhoids.
-BM are usually 4-5 on the Bristol stool chart
-Swollen turbinate and a deviated septum (ah my first bout of my HA. If I could go back in time I would prevent this lol).
-Fatigue
-some skin patches that idk if itâ€™s eczema or psoriasis. Leaning towards eczema since I have an intense family history of it.

Iâ€™ve had no weight loss, thankfully. I actually gained weight in Hawaii haha. So itâ€™s basically the burping, nausea that is making my HA spike. And it sucks because it makes me anxious that I have some deadly colon/stomach disease again, and Iâ€™ve considered making an appointment with my GI to see if I can get an endoscopy/colonoscopy, which he was very reluctant to do since Iâ€™m 22 years old. This burping and nausea is just so annoying and depressing. I had to go home from work because of it. Iâ€™ve been combating the vomiting well so far. Breathing sort of helps with nausea, as well as chewing gum and ginger ale. However, they havenâ€™t been as effective as before. My mind is going through so many possibilities of what this could be: hiatal hernia, GERD, postnasal drip from my nose problems, a general IBS flare up, a stomach ulcer, my stupid anxiety, or something worse. Itâ€™s just so fucking scary. The only thing that makes me feel better is sleep. Please, the best advice and/or reassurance.

"Muscle Twitch Around Knee Hey guys, only just discovered this subreddit today amidst another day of google searches - loved the ""Health Anxiety Starter Pack"" post!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what I'm asking for here, more just a bit of advise/guidance I guess.  I've always had some mild HA since my late teens and get abnormally anxious at the sign of any lump, bump or anomaly on my body.  Like a lot of others, the illness that puts the fear of death in to me is ALS/MND (from the UK).  I go through phases but over the past 6 or 7 years i've always tried to convince myself that i'm showing symptoms for it.  However, I'm 30 now and around 5 weeks ago I started to get a distinct muscle twitch just above my left knee (like lower right of the thigh).  It was fairly consistent, clearly visible but painless.  For context, I work in fairly stressful sales job, get a bit blue during Christmas/New Year in any case and had a lot to drink over the Christmas period with numerous nights out etc.  This seemed to compound the issue and really flare up my HA.

&amp;#x200B;

Since the turn of the year it's continued in the exact same location &amp; really seems to kick in when I pay attention to it.  However, when I play sports, workout and find myself away from my own thoughts it doesn't seem to impact me as much.  Recently it's started to impact my sleep and my work which is quite rare for me and very concerning.  I've read in and around 200 google articles and I can't help but feel everyone of them can't discount the likes of MS &amp; ALS etc. I feel like the twitches have became a bit more regular but they're just as isolated.  I've been to a physio, they claimed it may be a circulation issue and basically battered my left thigh to help....it didn't.  I've been to the docs and given blood - they came back fine.  I've got a follow up with her on the 25th and my plan is get a referral to a neurologist....although that scares the shit out of me.  The doc did mention it was unlikely but to me that just translates to ""there's still a chance"".

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried to convince myself that this is stress induced and i'm in a viscous struggle - I'm trying to run more and improve times to prove to myself that my muscles aren't degrading &amp; are actually improving....although all this does is make runs far more stressful than they used to be!  I've became a right pain in the arse at home and my negative outlook is having a bit of impact at home with my fiance (also getting married this year).  

&amp;#x200B;

Any guidance on how I should proceed with docs/consultants or any hints or tips to stem my worrying would be massively appreciated.

"At what age did your HA start? I have always been a bit uneasy about medical problems, but didnâ€™t start feeling physical symptoms until about a week and a half ago. With no triggers or life circumstances to speak of, my brain started telling me I need to take deeper breaths than I am capable of taking. The next day I hyperventilated so hard that my hands went numb and curled up tight. I am 24 and until recently I figured I had managed to evade young adult mental illness. Most people I know had it start at a much younger age.  Any other late bloomers here?",1
"The grand old duke of hypochondria, he had 10,000 symptoms, and when he was only half way dead he was suddenly fine again! Ever feel like every day is an uphill struggle? Youâ€™re master and commander of a rebellious army of terrible thoughts that you spend all day corralling into a manageable format only for them to break ranks out of the blue and leave you exhausted and all out of battle plans? 

You would concede, surrender, wave your white flag, if you could. But when youâ€™re fighting yourself, thereâ€™s no one to give in to, only a brief respite of broken sleep, spinning the roulette wheel of anxiety, will you wake up tomorrow with a new symptom or be granted a brief moment of peace? You pray for the latter and prepare for the former. 

Monday you wake up with nausea, the stomach cancer is back again. But, you also had abnormally painful cramps on your last period, so the logical explanation is that these symptoms are linked. The ovarian cancer from November is back and spreading, you were bloated last Friday too, if all makes sense when you put the pieces together. 

Pace the floor a little as you wait for the toaster to pop. Will I make a coffee? Hmm, the caffeine wonâ€™t help the nausea. Just stick to water and down your multivitamins, your antidepressants, the liquid iron for the self diagnosed anaemia. 

Palms are sweating, hands are jittery, a headache is setting in. Oh god, is this the blood pressure dropping or hypoglycaemia setting in? Only I could contract diabetes 15 minutes after learning of my terminal cancer diagnoses. 

The toaster pops, makes me jump a mile, heart racing.  Better check my pulse... great, a heart attack induced from the stress of my diabetes and cancer double blow. 

Dr google is ready to see you now.

â€œNausea abdominal painâ€ *search* 

What is this, amateur hour? Iâ€™ve been coming to this doctor for 15 years, I know better than to be so vague with my symptoms. Better be more specific. 

â€œNausea, shakiness, headache, sweating, dry mouth....â€

No, no no. Iâ€™ll just be told itâ€™s anxiety again. Far better to type in what I know it is and confirm my hunch with the list of symptoms that comes up. 

For the 300th time in a decade you search for heart failure, kidney infection, four different types of cancer, Parkinsonâ€™s, M.S, stomach ulcers, all the time internally scanning your body meticulously for developing symptoms... youâ€™re so good at this now that you can feel the tiniest disturbance in your body, a twinge in your arm, the blurry vision when you look at a particular angle in a certain direction, is that a post nasal drip coming on? 

And the day speeds on, leaving you in the dust, an exhausted heap of worry and fear. The hours pass, commitments left to the wayside as you forge on in the pursuit of truth about your terminal condition. Youâ€™re grumpy, snappy, why are people trying to talk to you when you are clearly on the cusp of finding out without doubt you have 6 days left to live? 

Typing away on your phone or laptop, a partner or a parent curiously asking what you are up to â€œare you on Facebook, honey?â€  You are short with them, youâ€™re busy. Weighing up whether to tell them the truth, youâ€™re dying again, knowing you will be met with rolling eyes or a speech about how youâ€™re fine, to stop worrying. So instead you keep quiet, they think youâ€™re in another mood, youâ€™re always so moody. 

The night draws in and youâ€™re done. Youâ€™ve scoured the forums, the articles, the YouTube videos. You still feel like crap, noticing youâ€™ve a sore throat and swollen glands. Great, HIV too.

Until, just before bed you do what you always do. Find the others like you, wrap yourself in the thin fraying blanket of comfort that comes when you accept there are others all over the world who are dying today, who receive new terminal diagnoses every other week,  those poor souls who receive crushing news of an incurable illness like most people receive spam email.

Health anxiety. A seemingly uninstallable app rooted in your brain with new and exciting updates every day.

Your foe, your enemy, your captor. 

Tuesday and Wednesday go off without a hitch, you have no symptoms, youâ€™re healthy for a couple days. Wednesday you caught norovirus from that person on the bus. Thursday it was gone but you woke up with Leukemia, how you managed to trudge into work after that blow was a miracle. Friday you were cured, Saturday the pinnacle of health, Sunday the cancer was back. 

And so the cycle continues. Held captor to a cruel brain (one with a tumour in it) that is so over sensitive to every bodily function, every twinge, that in its effort to inform your of your terrible illness, itâ€™s slowly killing your soul day after day. 

 Thereâ€™s hope for us yet. Once I went a whole month without silently battling a terrible incurable disease. One day that will be a couple months, then a year, and Iâ€™ll live like all the normal healthy people all around me. One day.

"Stressing a little of medication side effect Hi! I've been having issues with constantly feeling like I need to pee and not emptying my bladder for a few months now (although all medical tests have indicated there's nothing (at least structurally) wrong). I am a male. I was prescribed 0.4 mg Tamsulosin HCl (aka Flomax), which relaxes the muscles in the pelvic area, and muscle tension and anxiety are suspected to be the cause. I read through the booklet I got with the medicine and I just have concerns about the fact that one of the side effects is retrograde ejaculation (where semen enters the bladder instead of leaving the body...sorry for putting that image in everyone's heads). It itself is not a serious symptom, and I know even if it does happen, it will go away when I stop taking the medicine. I'm only taking it short term, too. I guess basically does anyone else also get stressed out about side effects? Any mental tips on how to stop being so crazy about it? Of course I know rationally that my doctor decided the benefit much outweighs potential risks, and that they always put every possible side effect because that's just legalese and what not. It's ridiculous because I know this medicine was given to me to HELP me! But this crazy irrational side of me can't just relax and take it.. ",1

"Have diverticulitis, now anxiety? I was diagnosed with diverticulitis in September.  Unfortunately, the infection spread through a hernia in my groin area and I developed an abscess in my groin.  I was hospitalized for ten days for treatment.  Last time I had been to the hospital was at birth 38 years before, so this was a shock.  I wasn't treated poorly or anything, just being away from my family, from work, from life, seemed to get me down.  I have a five year old and I face time'd with her while in the ER the first night and you could see the fear in her eyes.  She had only been in the hospital prior to visit great aunts, who would go on to pass away.  The look on her face is seared in my head and basically impossible to shake.  A fearful look because I'm sure she thought, when I see people in the hospital, I some times don't see them much longer after that.

It was a bit of a tough recovery, every ache, spasm, etc sent me into a panic.  Feeling my groin to see if I could feel a bulge from a returning abscess.  Pressing my lower abdomen to see if I was in pain from a recurrence of diverticulitis.  Sleepless night staring at my phone on healthline or Mayo Clinic.   Recently, I started having this bubble sensation in the sternum area near my chest, it would come out of nowhere and almost ""pop"" and be gone.  No rapid heartbeat, blood pressure normal, but the more I worried, the more they'd come along, mostly all at night, when my mind has more opportunity to wander.  One night was so bad I did go to the ER, they hooked me to an EKG, did a chest xray, blood tests.  Nothing really, no heart attack.  Was home in bed within a few hours.

My PCP suggested a holter monitor EKG which I wore for a day this week.  No results yet as the doctor has been out, but I'm guessing if it was anything truly pressing I'd have known by now.  I think folks here understand my predicament and I just needed to say it out loud to someone other than my wife.  She herself has had anxiety issues in the past and says it's probably a post traumatic anxiety.

"How I overcame health anxiety (read this is your currently struggling) So, i have been wanting to post this here but have been putting it off because this is going to be long so bare with me. If you want to know how I over came this bad disease keep reading, If your ready to recover keep reading. 

It all started when I was 16. Nothing necessarily trigger this other then I got sick one time (fever, body aches), and it had been a few years since I had a check up when my mom said â€œyou need to let me take you to the doctor for a check up because you wonâ€™t know if somethings wrong of you donâ€™tâ€. So when I got sick I decided to google it to see what was wrong, and leukemia was the first thing that popped up. My heart dropped. From that moment I was a google fanatic and thought I had every disease in the book. I suddenly started experiencing symptoms of leukemia like fatigue, and flu like symptoms. 

The after that I was worried I had a brain tumor. I had symptoms of that also, this was the worst one for me I think. I had a buzzing noise in my ear from time to time, blurred vision, fuzzy peripheral vision, headaches, pressure on the top of my head, slurred speech sometimes, nausea at time, etc. it was HORRIBLE. The symptoms were real. I was checked multiple times and I got a clean bill of health. 

Then I worried about skin cancer. I seen a dermatologist who confirmed I do NOT have skin cancer. 

I then found what I thought to be a lump in my abdomen and seen a doctor who said itâ€™s nothing but she ordered a CT with contrast to shut me up. That was clear as well BUT did say I had a very slightly enlarged spleen which could have been caused by mono when I was younger. 

I had many blood panels, EKGS, echocardiograms, CT scans, X-rays, urine tests, I saw a chiropractor, a dermatologist, and many MDs before I finally decided to accept that this was a mental issue and Iâ€™m NOT ill. It took me 5 long frustrating, scary, years before I agreed I had an issue with worrying over my health for no good reason. I seen two counselors and they helped, but I knew the change had to be within me! 

I finally accepted the facts. Google is not the most reliable source. In fact, only 42% of the health info found on google IS accurate. So your pretty much seeking reassurance from a uneducated stranger rather then just seeing your dr and trusting their diagnosis. Itâ€™s hard to agree these symptoms are in your head, but they ARE! You can make yourself feel all sorts of crazy symptoms, so if youâ€™ve seen a doctor and you have a good report, the only thing you should be googling is Health Anxiety symptoms and making sure your on a reliable website, such as webMD or Mayoclinic. Steer clear of yahoo answers, or any of the other forums that uneducated people  post on trying to give advice. In facts, steer clear of google and the web PERIOD! 

Hereâ€™s how I done it:

I scheduled a check up and wrote down ALL of my concerns. I talked to my doctor about my issues with anxiety and how bad I was making myself worry. He told me I need to stay FAR AWAY from google all together and I followed his orders. I had him do a full check up, ekg, blood work, STD testing, you name it just to at last, put my mind at ease. Once that was over and I was confirmed healthy, I started finding stuff to do like working out, surrounding myself with friends, and I got a job! I would leave my phone in the car locked up when I went into work. For a period of time I only used my phone for calls and texts. When i did have the urge to google Iâ€™d find something else to do. Like go for a walk and talk to myself about all the tests Iâ€™ve had. After ALL of these test, it would be very unlikely something so sinister would be missed! I knew it was mental so I would be easy on myself. Cry if need be. But donâ€™t check for lumps, donâ€™t start Letting your mind wonder, keep yourself occupied at least for the first few weeks. I would set new goals for myself (like school, work, gym). Find someone you trust and talk to them about your problems. Like for me, it was my mother. Work on IMPROVING your health. Eat healthy, get enough sleep, get a good amount of exercise each week, and take a supplement. And most of all remind yourself this is a mental thing when you start to worry and IMMEDIATELY distract yourself. Please keep in mind this is a process, it didnâ€™t get this bad over night so it will not be fixed over night, it will take time. Be patient with yourself. Talk to a counselor if you need to. 
ðŸ›‘STOP POSTING QUESTIONS LOOKING FOR ANSWERS! ðŸ›‘ because you wonâ€™t find them here, unless your looking for ways to over come anxiety. 

If you believe in God, pray often. If you need medication, take it.

Personally I never wanted meds because I donâ€™t want to be dependent on them. But if it helps you, take it. If you need a break from work. Take it. Put you first. 

If your scared to see a doctor make the appointment and MAKE yourself go for reassurance. Remember, if (god forbid) something is wrong, Itâ€™s better to find out  and take care of it then ignore it and it get worse (like, high blood pressure for instance, if you donâ€™t take meds it can potentially eventually damage arteries) but itâ€™s better to fix the problem and move on then to not do anything at all. But no matter what Google is not the answer. 

If anyone needs to talk or has questions feel free to ask me! I am pretty educated in the health field as Iâ€™ve done many heard of research as well as school
For registered nursing. I have family in the medical field, so if you feel you need to confide in someone done hesitate to DM me and we can work though this together, I donâ€™t want to see anyone waste years of their life like I did if I can help it!

"Anyone ever had lung/chest sounds? Would really appreciate your insight. I read a lot of the posts here and I nod along and think, â€˜Yeah, thatâ€™s me.â€™ But this is my first time posting, as Iâ€™m looking for some input and would be grateful for your thoughts. 

2018 was a busy year for me. I got married (and Iâ€™m very happy aside from the crippling HA) I run my own business and Iâ€™m fully self-employed. I lost 20 pounds doing a 10 week intense gym course and I got, wait for it, 8 colds.  HA nightmare.

Iâ€™m a 31 year old male and healthy (except for that undiagnosed illness that changes every month but is surely secretly killing me) but getting the cold 8 times last year really set my HA on a spiral. 

Thatâ€™s not the only â€œillnessâ€ I had last year. I had mouth ulcers and sore throats that I thought were somehow HIV. I had a sore on my tongue that at the time had to have been tongue cancer. I had a pain in my lower back which radiated into my testicles and down my left leg, which of course had to have been testicular cancer (saw the doc twice about this - no meds given) You all know the story, all of these things cleared up and I moved onto the next killer.

Anyway, I went and got my bloods tested yesterday and Iâ€™m awaiting results next week. I did this because I got so many colds last year and also I want to see whatâ€™s slowly â€œkilling meâ€. 

But my new symptom scares me. It a sound when I breathe deep. Like a bubbling or a mild rattling. Only sometimes, maybe around ten breathes a day, some days less, some days none. I am getting over a series of colds, as I mentioned. And I also have a tickley cough. Itâ€™s not chesty. And sometimes I cough of clear snot with it (sorry) 

I had this exact same episode Summer 2018 with the sounds etc and it all cleared up but has returned after a winter cold and it just wonâ€™t go away. Obviously Iâ€™m thinking lung cancer or that Iâ€™ll need a lung transplant etc 

I went to the doc, but because the sound/sensation is only there sometimes, he listened and said my lungs sound Chrystal clear. I wanted a chest x ray but he said he didnt see grounds for one at that point (a month ago)

Has anyone had any breathing sounds with anxiety? Like deep in your chest? 

Has anyone had stress/anxiety cause extra mucus that could maybe cause such a thing?

Would really love some input on this. 

Thanks in advance! 

TL:DR: Having sounds in my lungs every so often when taking a deep breath. Anyone have this and live to tell the tale? ",1
"I donâ€™t wanna be like this anymore Iâ€™ve been dealing with health anxiety ever since my mom was diagnosed with cancer. Every time I have some symptom, I google for hours until iâ€™ve convinced myself I have days left to live and have to go to the doctor right away. I saw my doctor yesterday and I could tell he thought I was insane and told me to stop googling stuff. Itâ€™s honestly so embarrassing and I feel like I have no control over myself anymore. He referred me to a psychologist within the first like 5 minutes of us talking. Iâ€™m just embarrassed and everyone around me is so annoyed with me constantly thinking I have some issue.

"Is this health anxiety?! Or something else Hello all, if you take time to read and respond to my post I thank you.

To begin ive been dealing with health issues since early September (about 4 months now). Could possibly be lyme or something else but the results were not very cut and dry. Ever since these health issss started ive been weighed down by â€œbrain fogâ€ or at least thats how I describe it to doctors. Ive read a bit about brain fog on here but my symptoms seem a bit different, could this still be alk anxiety (most of my doctors have labled this as my issue)

My symptoms of what i call â€œbrain fogâ€ is mainly visual, things look and seem a bit â€œoff/weirdâ€ not exactly blurry but just off. This feeling has been with me before (when i had mono 2 years ago) but it only lasted about 3 weeks, this time has been about 3 months constantly. My other symptoms are daily headaches, dizzy/unstable feeling, a feeling or fuzzy/congestion in my head (not really in sinuses but in head) and just feeling out of it.

I read a lot on this reddit about not being able to remember things or think clearly/concentrate. I dont have these issues, mine seem to be mainly visual paired with headaches. Is this being caused by my health anxiety? If not do you have any ideas?

Ive had an MRI, two CT scans and tons of bloodwork done in the last three months. All normal except my lyme came back positive. However after antibiotic treatment and still seeing strange results from bloodwork we are thinking it could be a false positive.  I definitely have anxiety about my health (been a rough few months) but I feel like of it was anxiety it wouldnâ€™t be causing these constant all day symptoms!  Any help is greatly appreciated.

"EKG changes and CT? Greeting, my anxious friends.  


I'll cut right to the chase!

&amp;#x200B;

From April 2018 - November 18th, I went to the hospital 14 times or so, each time with the same symptoms; feeling of rapid heartbeat, chest pain, profuse sweating and feeling of impending doom. Each time I had an EKG and bloodwork done and the results have always been perfectly normal. I've also had a Holter done in addition to several other monitors during admission.  


When I went to the hospital on November 13th my EKG was perfectly normal. When I went to the hospital again on November 18th, I suddenly had inverted Ts in my ST-segment, which they said could be indicative of insufficient oxygen to the heart muscle. From November 18th - present, I've had additional EKGs done which show the same change, but the doctors say that the EKGs, even with the change, is still perfectly normal. Some say there is no ischemia and that my heart is perfectly healthy, others say that they aren't concerned at all and that they don't suspect anything.  
I also had an extensive ultrasound done in November, which shows nothing abnormal. Valves are fine, no endocarditis, no extra sounds. Heart monitor during admission shows nothing abnormal either.  


Still, I am scheduled for a CT on January 22nd to rule out any atherosclerosis/blockages and I am scared to death of the pre-op medication they want to give me to lower my heart rate to between 40-50BPM.  


My question to the community is: Have you heard of depression/anxiety causing changes in your EKG? If you Google it, there is one article out of Columbia University that specifically mentions ST-inversions in patients with depression/anxiety.  


I am 27 years old, 190lbs, 6'4"" - I eat healthily and I've never smoked. I don't drink or do drugs either. The odds of me suddenly having ischemia, especially from one week to the next, is atomically small.

Our college is hosting a blood drive in a few days so I bought some iron supplements about a week ago because I once told the nurse that Iâ€™m often rejected due to low iron and the nurse said that a lot of people take iron supplements about a week before they donate. Well the supplements I bought are 65mg of elemental iron per pill. I started taking them before researching a safe dose because I didnâ€™t think you could OD on iron (yes very dumb).

"Love yourselfâ€”Take care of yourself. Historically, for me.. January-March is the hardest time for year for me.

My Anxiety journey began two years ago, in February. One of my best friends passed from a Brain Tumor, the month before. I went to his funeral and they talked about all the symptoms he had.... next thing I know, Iâ€™m consumed by constantly looking for the same symptoms. Then they start to appear.... One day, Iâ€™m fine. The next day I have a pain in my neck and googled it and was convinced it was cancer and I was going to die and leave my young wife and daughter. Then I had a full blown panic attack on Valentineâ€™s Day and ended up in the ER, convinced I was having a heart attack.

Since then, it has been on and off struggles with a brain tumor fearâ€”my longest battle. But every January, the anxiety comes back with a vengeance. I know this is the case for a lot of people... the bad weather, the dark days with not a lot to do, it takes a toll. 

Remember. Take care of yourself. Excercise, hell even just go on a walk. Distract yourself. Donâ€™t seclude yourself. Donâ€™t google. Eat your greens. TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF. 

Weâ€™re all fighting the same battle. Weâ€™re all constantly battling with the very real symptoms that our bodies have. The very real fear of passing before your time, or having a terminal disease. I care about each and every one of you. Hang in there. And letâ€™s fight the good fight every day. ",1

"Eyelids twitching for many months? Just wondering how many people here have had their eyelids twitching for many months (or longer)?  If you finally got it to go away, what did you do?

I see a lot of posts where people are stressing about eyelids twitches theyâ€™ve had for days or weeks (or sometimes hours).  But mine have twitched to varying degrees since last May or so.  I have tried several bouts of destressing, improving my sleep, meditating, exercising, eating bananas, drinking tonic water, taking multivitamins, ... but canâ€™t seem to get them to stop twitching.

I also notice if I blink hard, sneeze, look certain directions, etc that theyâ€™ll start twitching.  If I partially close my eyes then the muscles around my eyes quiver like theyâ€™re straining to hold the position.  Which leads me down the path of thinking itâ€™s more than stress / anxiety and something more in my muscles or nervous system.  Especially since it has lasted this long, through many periods of low stress.

"This is ruining my life. I need to make a change. Title says it all. This is ruining my life and making me feel like life isn't even worth living. All I do is obsess and worry and browse the internet. I'm 27 F, and in the past week I have gone from worrying about brain tumours to MS to early onset Parkinsons to liver cancer, blood cancer, Meneire's disease, diabetes, and other illnesses. 

I've been like this my whole life. I don't even know why, but ever since I've been a kid I've been worried about my health. I was a semi sick child, but nothing life threatening or horrible. I have been seeing a therapist off and on since I've been 14 and it does help, though I haven't gone in a few weeks. 

2 months ago I began getting vertigo. Doctor told me it was an inner ear problem, and the whole thing made my anxiety completely spiral out of control. I haven't stopped thinking about whats wrong with me or worried about not being dizzy for longer than 15 minutes in the last 10 weeks. The room spinning vertigo is gone, I'm just left with some random dizzy spells and disequilibrium/unsteadiness. I was convinced the doctor missed something, so they agreed to do some blood work and booked an MRI. They don't seem overly concerned but said they will do it. I'm waiting for the MRI, but just got news back from my bloodwork. Apparently it's all normal expect for my B12, which is elevated (cut off is 950 and I'm 1048).. This is pretty unusual, since B12 is normally low if anything. I have been taking B12 supplements, so I'm going to try to assume that's what caused it (the nurse told me about the blood results and the doctor has yet to follow up, so I don't know what to do about it besides stop taking the supplement) but of course my crazy self went on Google and found out high B12 can be indicative of blood or liver cancers and is really serious. Cue freak out. 

I'm just done. I'm so done living like this. I don't know what the follow up will be for the B12, if anything, but I'm just going to be sitting here wanting to browse the internet in hopes of making myself feel better when in reality I never will. I will sit here and think about every bodily sensation and worry about feeling off balance, and worry about something sinister going on and picturing all the horrible scenarios that are going to happen and how I'm going to die young and suffer and leave my children motherless. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just have to make a change. Even if I do have blood cancer or liver cancer (my current fear), there isn't anything I can do about it. It's not like worrying is going to make it go away, so why do I do this to myself? I can't do another day like this, searching for answers and being constantly scared. I've booked an appointment with my psychologist for this Wednesday and I am vowing to myself to get off Google and never go back on for answers. I don't know what else to do yet, but I feel this is a good start.

"Healthy anxiety is literally going to kill me (Sorry for the essay) Okay so you're all going to probably think I'm a nut job and you're probably right.. I've been a bit of a hypochondriac since a child but it's gotten way worse in recent years (I'm now 27). I actually don't even know what to do anymore? I went to counselling about this last year and it did zilch! The past year has been my absolute worst!!!

I'm a Googler and it's really starting to piss me off! Every single pain I get I end up googling it and lose my shit thinking it's cancer or something deadly. Heck, sometimes I don't even Google it and I just assume it's something bad! The anxiety got that bad in the summer time that I was crying every night and having no sleep thinking I was going to die and couldn't get out of bed for work. I'd literally made my self depressed. I then did actually get really ill from all the worry and stress. I just don't want to have death thoughts everytime I feel a pain or a niggle! I'm even getting scared of feeling my own breasts incase I feel a lump!!! I also hate it when I see articles on Facebook telling you the symptoms to look out for for certain cancers and then those symptoms are stuck in my brain for life and I end up tying those symptoms to my pains and thus the anxiety begins! I'm literally stressed and on edge every single day now, it's exhausting!

So my question is, is there anybody else out there suffering with this too? And how are you coping with it? I literally can't go on like this, feeling like i'm going to die all the time. It's an absolute waste of life.

"Dealing with ALS Anxiety Hi All,

This is my first post here, but I've found the content extremely helpful as I've tried to manage my anxiety about ALS for the last week or so. 

I'm a 30 year old male, in what I would consider very good health, but since an incident 2 weeks ago I've had extreme and debilitating health anxiety about having terminal cancer or ALS. 

It started with numbness and tingling in my feet, legs, and eventually groin after watching a live basketball game in an uncomfortable chair. I was already worried due to a urinary issue that started a week before this incident (and has since resolved) so I think I was a bit more on edge than normal. 

Anyway, since this event I've had the perception of weakness in my body and the feeling comes and goes. I don't have any evidence of actual weakness, but when I think about lifting weights I dont think I can lift the same amount that I'm used to. As a result, I'm compelled to do strength tests with objects around me. It's a nightmare. 

To make matters worse my thumb on my left hand had been twitching slightly for 2 days now. I can see a visible pulsation in my hand near the base of my thumb and hand. I'm thinking my thumb may be twitching as a result of whatever artery/vein is there, but I'm really scared. 

I've gone to a few doctors over the last few weeks (urologist and nurse practitoner) and they haven't flagged anything as a cause for concern. I'm set to see my PCP on Friday. ALS fear is consuming my life... can anyone help?",1
"Home Remedies for Dehydration Dehydration occurs when your body has lost more fluid than you have taken in. Remaining hydrated is critical to your overall health. Every cell in your body needs water, along with oxygen, to function properly.

Anyone can become dehydrated, but those at a higher risk include infants, young children, older adults, people with chronic illnesses, endurance athletes and people living at high altitudes.

Some common causes of dehydration are vigorous exercise in hot weather, diarrhea, vomiting, excessive sweating and increased urination.

"Anxiety about heart Last week I went to the emergency room for heart palpitations. They did a chest x-ray, EKG, and blood work. In the end, I was told that I had a spot on my lung and a slight irregularity in the EKG. Blood work was all fine. It was suggested I follow up with a cardiologist for an echocardiogram and 24-hour holter monitor and a radiologist for the CT. I had the CT scan done last Friday and it was a calcification in the lung (probably from a childhood of asthma, bronchitis, and pleurisy). No big deal. However, the palpitations had worsened to the point I couldn't sleep on Thursday (they're at their worst when I try to sleep). I spoke to the cardiologist and he suggested magnesium which has helped calm it down I think. However, I've now developed a cough which has been worsening over the last few days. I went in to the cardiologist this morning to get the 24 hour EKG put on and drop off the CT scan results and, just an hour after, the nurse called and asked if I would be okay to move my appointment from next Monday to this Friday at 9 am. I am completely freaked out that there is something really wrong--especially since the appointment was moved up. If the doctor had noticed anything really wrong, would he have gotten me in more immediately? I think all the anxiety about the condition is making all the symptoms worse and I'm not really sure how to stop it completely. Any advice is appreciated. ",1
"Worried about colon cancer... again. Hey all long story short Iâ€™ve been worried I have colon cancer for like 5 years now with months of not worrying alternating with weeks of major anxiety. Iâ€™m 24/ M / 190 Pounds and have struggled with blood on the toilet paper every few months. About a year ago I went to urgent care to try and remedy my worry, had a digital rectal exam that the doctor said was â€œtotally normalâ€ which relieved me for all of about a month. For the last few months Iâ€™ve felt like I finally beat my worry and today I went and had like 2 little drops of blood on the wipe I used even after a relatively soft and easy to pass stool. So now Iâ€™m here, trying to decided if I should pay up and have a colonoscopy or if Iâ€™m just letting my anxiety get to me again. Anybody else have this fear or any advice for someone who does?

"Scaring myself I have cancer? Basically what it says. My left armpit I noticed, when I was in the shower at times it feels a little sensitive! I googled this and it says breast cancer or lymphoma. So now Iâ€™m worried about that. I donâ€™t feel bumps though. 

I was also reading about experiencing pain after alcohol! Sometimes when I take a shot, my upper back and head hurt, I feel like I have a heavy weight on me. Read this can be lymphoma symptoms, now very worried!

"At the end of my rope, no idea what to do and constantly want to kill myself for feeling this way. IMPORTANT: I am not currently in danger of hurting myself and i have the suicide prevention number in my phone. I AM however always contemplating killing myself to free myself from this constant health related anxiety. 

I am a 26 year old american guy, no health insurance. 

For the past 8 years now Ive been battling some absolutely crippling health anxiety. After almost dying doing some drugs in college I really shouldnt have (K2/spice), I have been in constant fear that I am dying for one reason or another ever since.

 Ive convinced myself I had heart failure and had multiple echos, EKGs, ultrasounds, etc of my heart done, all clear. The stress from all of that caused me to develop migraines really badly within the first year. Those migraines caused me to convince myself I had an aneurysm or meningitis, so I had CT Scans, MRIs, angeograms, a spinal tap, all came back clear and I was told it is just migraines. This has been going on for years and this past summer I spent a month in an inpatient facility for actually trying to kill myself over it.

Now, after recently reading about a brain eating amoeba killing a woman in seattle for using a neti pot, ive been sleepless and at a 12/10 on the anxiety scale convinced Ive got only a week left to live. 

I'm at the end of my rope, I dont know how to stop feeling this way all the time. I have constant panic attacks, I spend a lot of my days crying and I am just so paralyzing AFRAID that I'm dying I can hardly function.

Please, what should I do? ",1
"Hit my head about 2 months ago, have vertigo and memory issues Hi guys. I hit the side of my head very hard on the corner of a table in late November.

"death anxiety plus health anxiety after my fathers death hi folks, my dad passed away on december 2018 after a horrible accident who drove him in a coma state, after a month in the intensive care unit he lost a lot of weight, he looked  soo skiny and fragile, i was witness of his extreme agony, then he woked up from the coma state just to realize that he had irreversible neurological damage, everytime when i went to visit him to his room, he started to cry, feeling unable to speak due the damage.

when everything looks stable to my dad (aparently) the doctors tooks the desicion to send him to our house, and then start to the recovery terapy regime, in the second day, he died, the cause of his dead maybe was due cardiac issues, since then i cant sleep properly, my mind are broken, i can see my dad in my nigthmares, suffering as the days when he was at the hospital, now i have an existencial crisis, i realize that life is so short, also im suffering from health anxiety, i fear to heart diseases, always checking my heart rate, my blood pressure, and when i sleep, in my dreams, i can see my body in a coffin, feeling that im dying or already dead

what can i do guys? i know this is part of the grief, but what can i do for the health anxiety?, i used to smoked weed, since that incident and due the health anxiety everytime when i smoked i experienced full blown panic attacks, i die in my nigthmares, i see my dad suffering in those dreams....

note: my dad was young, and his dead was unexpected.

"No relief... It's pretty frustrating but knowing my anxiety is causing me a lot of these worrying physical sensations, it doesn't make them go away. I'm well aware that I'm struggling with health anxiety and when things flare up I tell myself over and over that it's a mental problem but I still don't get much relief.

I take painkillers almost every day for various aches and pains, I try sipping water when my throat feels tight. I know I don't get enough exercise (it can exacerbate feeling shaky and lightheaded) and I probably don't eat right either. I get low moods and feel unmotivated a lot of the time.

"I'm so done with these thoughts I can't deal with this anymore. Every ache, pain, itch or sensation is something that I'm hyperaware of. I can't go a day without thinking there's something wrong with me. Every night I lie in bed wondering if I'll wake up in the morning, and every morning I dread getting up out of bed. 

I'm not too bad when I'm with people, it's when I'm alone with my thoughts is when they really start to manifest. I'm 19 and currently in university and this is having an impact on my work and social life. This all began after I lost my grandmother to cancer last November. Seeing the struggle messed me up, and it didn't help that she died in my house and I spoke to her the night before she passed. 

I'm just so damn sick of this. What the hell do I do? I feel so suffocated by myself. I'm at breaking point.

"Shortness of Breath Hi,

I'm a 28 year old relatively healthy male who experienced my first ever panic attack on January 3rd (after waking up sometime in the beginning of December having a mini-attack and shortness of breath followed for weeks). I was sitting at home watching Friends and my left arm started tingling and immediately my heart started pounding and I started sweating - I eventually calmed down and went to the emergency room (i've never done that before) to get checked out - the doctor checked my blood pressure, oxygen, etc and said everything looked fine. 

I felt really weird after that. I had an appointment with my family doctor to get blood work, an ECG, and a lung/chest x-ray done and yesterday I was told that everything looked fine on the scans.

Today I got shortness of breath again. Has anybody experienced something like this before? Is it normal for shortness of breath to linger for a few months when you're feeling stressed?

I don't want to become a hypochondriac and I trust my doctor but it just feels off to me.

"Anyone else here with HA who works in a biomedical/disease-related field? Hi everyone! This community is a great support on days I'm feeling bad, and I've had this question on my mind for awhile. 

I've struggled with anxiety my entire life, officially diagnosed w/ GAD when I turned 13, and have been on meds/in therapy since. One component of my anxiety is bouts of severe hypochondria that wax and wane as far as I can remember (my earliest memory of this is crying to my mom because I was terrified of having cancer and dying - I was 7). 

While I was terrified of diseases, I was also fascinated by them. I remember watching Mystery Diagnosis episodes when I was in middle school (which, while super cool to me when watching, would result in me later being terrified by whatever disease the episode featured). When I began seeing a therapist and psychiatrist, I got very interested in mental illness, and later that led me to an interest in neurological disease in high school, which, eventually, as it turned out, morphed into my career. 

(Very) long-story-short, I ended up getting my undergraduate degree in neuroscience, and am now a 1st-year PhD student in molecular biology, where I study protein misfolding in neurodegenerative diseases. For someone who spent much of their life with bad HA, it's very ironic that so much of my time is now spent attending lectures on disease and taking courses in pathology. I still struggle with my anxiety, but regularly see a therapist &amp; psychiatrist to keep things in check. 

My experience has led me to wonder if anyone else in this community has a biomedical/research/disease-related job? If so, I'd love to hear your stories. ",1

"Has anyoneâ€™s anxiety gave them upper back pains? 23F. I am currently dealing with upper back pains (specifically in between and around my shoulder blades) and I have no idea the cause. I donâ€™t work out, nor I barely lift anything more than 5lbs. I work in retail, the most my body ever hurts is when I finally sit down and my feet. I sleep in the same left side position I have been for the last 2 years or so and this also helped out with my gastric issues. Iâ€™m not sure if itâ€™s my posture, but I canâ€™t disagree that it could be. But, I get no relief when I straighten my back. This pain/ache does have the tendency to migrate between left and right, spreads out in a line, and seems to never go past 1/2 inch of my shoulder blades. 

The most that has changed in the last two months was my health anxiety, brought on because I thought I had esophageal cancer (spoiler: I donâ€™t) and was actually suffering from an abnormal narrowing of my esophagus and was later discovered that I also had a mild case of gastritis and duodenitis that was **definitely** caused by my anxiety. Back to normal, lab work said that I had no infection or pre-cancerous tissue with a follow up of a barium swallow tomorrow. I got over and past my anxiety towards esophageal (and stomach) cancer. 

But, my upper back pain is starting to trigger me badly because I canâ€™t stop switching between â€œyou have lung cancerâ€... â€œnope, itâ€™s pancreatic cancerâ€....â€œlung cancerâ€....â€pancreatic cancerâ€ and so on and so forth. I started checking for jaundice, my breathing, my lymph nodes, WebMDâ€™ing/Mayo Clinicâ€™ing, the whole sha-bang. The upper back pain came on roughly last week during a horrible nausea and vomiting episode for not taking my PPI. Most of my body went to normal, but my back didnâ€™t. It doesnâ€™t really help that during my episode... my entire back spazzed and stiffened up when I was laying down on my back. Didnâ€™t stop until I managed to turn to my side. Yesterday, I panicked so badly that I made an appointment with a counselor, a psychiatrist, and a physician. 

**TL;DR:** I have migrating upper back pains for ~2 weeks, no known cause from what I know. Bad HA in the last 2 months. Iâ€™m becoming fearful that itâ€™s between pancreatic and/or lung cancer.

"DVT Anxiety Hi all, 

&amp;#x200B;

So starting Monday morning my right leg (thigh just above the ankle) started to hurt in a weird mix of a cramp and DOMS like way. The pain didn't go away for three days now and yesterday when examining it with my gf my leg has also swollen and became tender at the area where the pain comes from.

&amp;#x200B;

This morning I went to my GP who measured my legs, and examined them with her hands. She said she doesn't think it is a vein issue just a pulled or twisted muscle, so I should just rest and take over the counter muscle relaxing meds. I told her that I did not do anything particularly active over the weekend (just sleeping and playing video games pretty much), she still said that I could have just strained a muscle while sleeping and it might keep on hurting for 1-2 weeks even. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am still very worried and anxious as DVT is often misdiagnosed and people even die after being sent home thinking that it is just a muscle strain. My leg still hurts with no improvement whatsoever (maybe even getting a bit worse, although that might just be my brain), it is swollen in one area, but I am not feeling extra warmth and there is no discoloration.

"GERD Fears - Please Help Hello, been a while since I posted here. Anyways, I've had on and off acid reflux since I was 19 or 20 (23 now). It started when I went to an ENT because my singing voice wasn't quite right (I sang a cappella in college) and he said ""oh you probably have GERD"". Never did a diagnostic test or anything. 

Then came Summer 2017. I heard that acid reflux can lead to Barrett's and then esophageal c. Coincidentally, I also started to feel a lump in my throat, which I knew HAD to be esophageal c. So, I got an endoscopy. It came back clean with a little irritation. BUT, it was clean! Great. Needless to say, the lump disappeared. 

I've been on and off meds for GERD ever since. For the past 6-9 months, I've been off them because, truthfully, my reflux hasn't been bad. Tums or Zantac usually suffices if I need it. PPIs aren't good long term anyways. 

About five days ago, the lump in my throat returned. Coincidentally, I've been drinking more coffee lately and being very liberal with my diet. I'm hoping the lump is one of two things. 1. Irritation from increased reflux due to liberal diet. 2. Cricopharyngeal spasm (essentially the upper sphincter in throat being too tight due to anxiety, stress, etc.). I am literally praying to God every night that it isn't anything worse, but I'm still terrified. Could my clean scope have progressed to Barrett's or worse in a year and a half? 

Background - I suffer from chronic OCD, anxiety, and depression. I just started my first real job since graduating college and recently moved into a new apartment. I've suffered from a sphincter spasm before... it was down south... not fun. When I take my klonopin (IT IS PRESCRIBED) it seems to get better. Additionally, my throat feels better when eating, drinking, or in the morning. PLEASE HELP ME.

"Back here again Damn colon cancer.

I'm afraid again and it seems more palpable than ever. This started two years ago after getting some blood work done. I got in my head that I could have colon cancer.

All my symptoms began after all results were good. I started having some light blood on my stool (a line here and there). Then my right lymph node grew, then shrunk, then grew and so on (it's still swollen but smaller). Then I started having diarrhea and watery dolls with a feeling of incomplete evacuation. Then I started noticing my skin is getting pale, more visible veins.(I sometimes see myself going from normal to pale to normal a couple of times in a day). I do the palmar crease pallor test almost constantly now.

I noticed that my fingernails were either pale or blue - ish sometimes (started thinking of iron deficiency and that scares the cap out of me).

Then I started feeling weaker, tired, after very little effort (should note that I put on 10 kg in this time). Arms started feeling weaker, got some armpit pain, chest pain, etc.

Then my back started hurting. My lower left back. Sometimes my lower right too. Then it started hurting more and more often. Now it hurts along my left leg as well as left hip. I read a post a while ago that said the op was diagnosed after very similar symptoms, so naturally I started freaking out again.

Now I'm seeing some similar stuff with my dad and it really drives me back to freaking out.

"I'm Going Crazy (Brain Tumor fear) Hey guys.
(Sorry if my grammar may seem a bit choppy. English is not my first language). 
I'm running into alot of anxiety. I feel like I'm losing my mind at this point. 

I have been experiencing neurological symptoms that seem to come and go by months. It all started on Thanksgiving. The very first symptom was a strange headach. It was dull yet slightly painfull. What followed afterward was strange weakness feeling in my sholdure and jaw. These symptoms suddenly went away the after. A week I had expreinces no symptoms. In the beginning of December, I began to experience these same symptoms again. 

All day I could not keep my mind off of these symptoms. I eventually succumbed into a full blown panic attack. Those specific moment felt like I was about to die. 
The symptoms continued throughout the month of December. During this time I was able to go to my family doctor. He seemed to shrug it off.
They took my blood, which turned out to be normal. 
My anxiety not stopping either. These symptoms would occasionally relive than come back. There are period where these symptoms would become stronger and new ones will form. I began to expreince strange dizziness. My balance also felt slightly off. I could not keep my mind off of it. 

After Christmas, my symptoms seemed to have completely vanished. The symptoms seem to have been gone for a good month or so.  Somehow everything felt better and I thought that was the end of that.  

Boy was I wrong. 

The symptoms all returned. And back came my anxieties of impending doom. 
I did notice that these symptoms returned when my period was beginning to start. It did get worse when I was on my period.... I don't know if that matters. 

I'm still very worried that I have a brain tumor. I feel like that my family and friends think im going crazy, but they just dont understand. I'm scared and have no where to go... ",1

I counted over 20 blood test and so far every single thing has come back normal.  

One doctor thinks I have thoracic outlet, but another doctor says I don't and that they are just trying to slap a generic label on my problem.  This doctor also believes it is my body stuck in ""fight or flight mode.""  The one issue that seems odd is that after using my right hand, such as in typing, my fingers will visibly slightly swell and my hand feel tight.   I know stress can cause muscle tightness and my PT keeps commenting out tight the muscles are on the right side of my body from jaw to shoulder.  Has anyone had anxiety/stress cause physically visible symptoms such as swelling? ",1

"I need advice on what to do with my Enlarged Spleen &amp;#x200B;

In early december I found out that I have an enlarged spleen after MANY trips to the ER and being sent home because I was having ""a panic attack"" (which I have never had before) Finally, after probably over 10 visits I got a Doctor who believed me and got me appointments within days... At the time I thought it was my heart, I had a stress test done, and a echocardiogram, they said my heart was in really good condition.

We also discovered I had a high D-dimer and was sent for a CT scan for a pulmonary embolism, which was clear too. My D-dimer has come down since to around 511, much better but not super.

I then got a ultrasound of my gut because they thought maybe it was my galbladder, which was fine, they did however find out that my spleen was enlarged, it was something like 13.5 cm, so not super enlarged, it is still enlarged and it effects my day-to-day life. For example I cannot lie down on that side or cannot eat too much or it gets aggravated.

I have been tested for Mono, it was clear, I have just recently (2 days ago) gotten my mirena removed (I need to illiminate all possibilities no matter how small) and he has put me on a high dose of 2 different antibiotics. There is nothing left that I can think of that could enlarge my spleen besides cancer or some sort of virus that has not been found.

Other symtoms I am having, currently I have a cough, but I am getting a cold now. However I have had a dry couch since november. I can feel my nodes in my neck and they are really uncomfortable if touched or I turn my head in a funny way. Inside my left ear hurts occassionally, as well as my left side of my jaw, sort of where the ear pain meets my jaw. The nodes in my armpits occassionally hurt too. And sometimes my hands have a sort of aching pain as if I used them for something hard and the muscles were healing.

The doctor keeps telling me to relax and enjoy my upcoming trip and enjoy life but WTH! Everything I have read online says ""AN ENLARGED SPLEEN IS NOT NORMAL"" I don't know where to go from here, I need help, advice... Something. I am Canadian, if that makes a difference. Thank you if you have gotten this far....",1
"New Here Unfortunately Hi all. I am new to this forum and thought I might gain some reassurance from others who are having the same issues as myself. 

The last year or so has been filled with a few periods of time in which my health anxiety peaked. This often left me confused and helpless. Everything I feel or see makes me question if I am becoming seriously ill in some way. 

About 3 years ago I had my first issue with HA. I was having chest pains while playing baseball at school. I actually ended up going to the hospital for this and had an ECG. I was told that my heart was fine and it may just be growing pains as I was about 14 at the time. 

The next problem was where it really started to get much worse. About a year ago while showering I noticed a light brown spot (which was probably just a stain or dirt of some sort) on my foot sole. I could not stop thinking about this and was constantly measuring and photographing the spot to make sure it didnâ€™t grow. I couldnâ€™t help but to think this was melanoma. The dot eventually disappeared on its own after about 2-3 weeks. 

Next came issues of tingling in feet and hands. Being like I am, I did the worst thing you could probably do which was google it. Of course it is a symptom of diabetes. I now constantly feel what I believe to be different symptoms happening each day. Each symptom I hear of miraculously occurs the next day. In fact, I feel as if my vision is becoming blurred (another symptom of diabetes) as I type this. 

I know these symptoms appearing just after I learn of them is just my mind messing with me. Does anyone have any advice on how they were able to cope with these underlying thoughts? ",1
"Stomach problems for 1 month Hi guys, me again :)

So Iâ€™ve been having stomach issues for the past month which I am pretty sure are due to anxiety / stress, but still have got me worried!

It began a month ago, when I took some magnesium on an empty stomach ( Iâ€™ve been taking it to help with palpitations) and I got crazy stomach cramps. Since then, Iâ€™ve had gas and bloating and uncomfortable bowel movements. I went to a doctor overseas (Iâ€™ve been traveling) who didnâ€™t do any tests but just told me to take probiotics which I have been doing. 

Now that is been a couple weeks and things havenâ€™t gone away Iâ€™m beginning to get worried. However, I canâ€™t go to the doctor yet because my medical insurance doesnâ€™t kick in until February 1st. 

A couple more details on my current symptoms: I have gas and bloating in the morning and before I go to bed. No problems really during the day. The pain does seem to be more localized on my right hand side. I do also get heartburn. 

Why I think it might be anxiety is because 1) Iâ€™ve travelled to 4 different time zones in the period of a 6 weeks which usually messes with my digestion. 2) Iâ€™ve been pretty anxious and stressed out because of traveling, flying, and looking for work. 3) my diet has been really out of whack as Iâ€™ve been in so many countries recently so I eat whatever is there.

Iâ€™m finally back home for good now, so stress is going down but the symptoms have not unfortunately:( what do you guys think? I donâ€™t want to go to the doctor until I get insurance because it will be very expensive but waiting a week or more to see what is going on is killing me! ",1

"Psyching myself out over hereditary cancer So this last Summer my mother was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer that has since gotten way worse. When she was diagnosed and they were testing her they found out that she a gene that can cause it and that gene can be passed down to my brother and I. I donâ€™t even know the exact details of it, but Iâ€™ve read stuff about how with hereditary colon cancer you have anywhere from a 50-80% chance of developing it anytime before youâ€™re 50. That obviously scares the absolute shit out of me. 

They said even with a healthy diet and exercise you still have a chance of getting it before 50. You can only do so much to control it basically. I went to see one doctor for something unrelated and she told me I needed to get screened at age 32 (Iâ€™m 22) but Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™ll get it before then and itâ€™ll be too late. 

My mother didnâ€™t realize she had it for over a year and when she finally had symptoms she was already stage 4. 

Idk Iâ€™m freaking myself the hell out because Iâ€™ve battled intense health anxiety all my life and whatâ€™s happening to my mother and what Iâ€™ve learned from it is triggering the fuck out of me. It doesnâ€™t help that Iâ€™m extremely picky and find it harder than most to eat healthy and the only exercise I get is walking and light lifting at work. ",1
"Tingling left chin and other parts - should I be concerned? Hi guys,

So straight into it - I was stressing (panic attack probably) about my brotherâ€™s health (He got Leukaemia a few years ago) because I had thought it had came back. Also been pretty depressed thinking about in the past 2 months (never knew how bad it was). 

Now when I was worried about this, I felt a tingling sensation on my left chin. This was around two weeks.  Maybe 4 times or so this has happened, however recently it feels like it has been more recurring (not sure if focusing on it has to do with it). I was super stressed thinking Iâ€™ve got cancer so I got my CBC, which there was no issue with.

Now I went to the dentist today and told him about the tingling. He said to me to get an x-ray and he really wasnâ€™t sure why it was like that. My wisdom teeth had came through and he was pretty stern on me getting it checked. That scared me a decent amount, he said that x-ray will show what the problem is.


Since this ordeal and getting the all clear after the CBC, I will get random tingling throughout my body for a few seconds in small sports it goes away. (As soon as I move my limb or finger, they go away) Iâ€™ve also been a bitch more itchy of late and get the occasional sharp pains.


However apart from this Iâ€™ve been fine (no other symptoms) Eating a lot, lots of energy, no headaches, not feeling tired, no blood in stool and no night sweats. Iâ€™m just concerned what this could be. Should I be concerned? 

Thanks guys love you all!",1

"Contacting an Ex about STD Testing I've been dealing with healthy anxiety, particularly with being exposed to STDs (specifically HIV). I've only had sex (stupidly, unprotected) with one guy, an ex from two years ago. I realize what a huge mistake that was and I have since gotten tested for all STDs  and tested negative for HIV using the 4th generation test. Last time I was tested was Aug. 2018. However, I've had a long list of symptoms since the exposure, thus the anxiety. I haven't been able to put the fear and anxiety behind me. There hasn't been a day within the last two years that I haven't thought about having hiv. I understand that the tests are negative and I should believe the results, and I want to. I'm about to start a new stage in my life and need to desperately put this behind me (it's been legitimately driving me crazy). I can't eat, think/focus, sleep nowadays. 

I've come to the conclusion that perhaps the only thing I think would put my mind to rest is reaching out to my ex ( who I had the unprotected sex with) himself. The thing is I haven't talked to him in over a year and have no idea how I would go about talking about this to him. But if an awkward conversation is the price I have to pay for my sanity and control of my life back then I have to do it. How do you suggest I go about this?  Do I go straight to the point? I'd suggest him to get tested for confirmation. 

Please, any advice would mean the world.",1
"Can't stop worrying about oral cancer I am a 20 year old and I have pretty bad HA I've had it under control for a little while now until recently when I felt a few little lumps on my gums at first I thought maybe it's a canker sore or something but my anxiety got the best of me when I saw an ad about oral cancer and it kicked my into the deep end. Now I don't know how long they were there so it was just recently I discovered it but I thought for sure that I had oral cancer. I called my dentist asked for him to check it out just to be safe he said ok. I went in today got a couple of x ray's than he looked in my mouth with the mirror thing he said ""Your x ray's came back good and I don't see anything wrong it looks like it might be just bit of extra bone but you have nothing to worry about."" for some reason my anxiety won't let me accept that. I have been trying everything to accept hat my dentist said but for my anxiety tells me ""Maybe he missed it?""

"Toenail Melanoma? This sounds so stupid, but Iâ€™m worried about toenail melanoma.  I recently removed my nail polish and noticed that on one of my toenails, a little less than half of it is a light brown color. The pigment starts from the edge of the nail so itâ€™s not a sole brown line.  It just looks like half of my nail lengthwise is a darker shade. For reference I am under 30 and darker-skinned, and Iâ€™m fairly sure Iâ€™ve had this pigmentation for awhile and itâ€™s been noticed by my derm, but since Iâ€™ve had my nails painted Iâ€™m worried that somehow it changed or it looks different than I remember. 

I know itâ€™s more common on the thumbs, index fingers, big toes - and itâ€™s not on either of those. My two pinky toenails also currently have some brown pigmentation basically covering the whole nail. In all three toenails have some funky darker pigmentation going on right now.  Admittedly this has been the first time Iâ€™ve cut my toenails in a little over a month so they were long. I also tend to wear heels frequently so Iâ€™m not sure if this pigmentation is more trauma based?

Iâ€™ve been to the derm a few times in the past year for cancer/mole related concerns so Iâ€™d hate to keep going back. Any thoughts?",1
"Whilst falling asleep - jolted awake with panic. Any tips to overcome? Hi all,

Iâ€™m currently battling with myself, Iâ€™ve convinced myself I have something wrong with my heart due to some pains in my chest, despite seeing the doctor twice and them confirming itâ€™s nothing to worry about. 

Whilst Iâ€™m up and about in the day I can deal with it and distract myself. However, Iâ€™ve found that almost every night as Iâ€™m falling asleep, just as I drift off; I have a feeling my heart has stopped/Iâ€™m having a heart attack and it holds me wide awake. 

Iâ€™m at wits end, and so done with being exhausted every day due to it taking hours each night to actually get to sleep.

My doctors havenâ€™t been very useful with advice, so has anyone else had a similar experience and have any tips on how to get over this?

"Waiting on results, the last few anxious hours are the worst. Iâ€™ve been struggling with medical issues for a while now that are definitely exaggerated by health anxiety which has been hard in many ways. Mainly because I never know when Iâ€™m experiencing a real symptom or my anxiety is just getting the best of me. My doc wanted me to see a neurologist who ordered an MRI. I missed the call last night with what I thought would be results which left me waiting all night. I was so ready to call this morning and have my anxiety put to ease but all they said was the results were not specific enough and the neurologist wants to see them himself. So that brings me to now, about 10 am. At 11 I am planning to go grab the disk from the imaging center in my town and then bring it to drop off at my neurologist a little over an hour away. Then I have to drive home and wait for a call again. Ugh Iâ€™m so sick of the waiting and Iâ€™m scared itâ€™s not a good sign that he needed to see it himself before giving me results.",1

"Pulsatile tinnitus So over the last week or so I've noticed that for about 10-15 seconds each day, I've heard a pulsing sound in my ear that sounds like a fan whirring. At first I thought it was an external sound, but then I pinned it down to coming from inside my head when I was in the bathroom one time. I googled it and it came up with pulsatile tinnitus, and it said the cause could be tumours, aneurysms, high blood pressure, hearing loss etc. 

I hear it in my right ear, and as I said it's normally for around 10 seconds a day at random times. I've been unable to trigger it or find a way to induce it; there seems to be no pattern to it. Which is odd because people who mention this talk of it being constant.  

I exercise regularly and do cardio, and I'm cutting down on my caffeine consumption to see if that helps. I've heard this can be a symptom of anxiety or can just be heightened awareness of my own body, which makes sense but don't exactly know what that means. You'd think I'd have noticed this before.

After i took a hit, I had a hard time accepting the reality of the situation, which is the key point I am making here. As I have improved with my anxiety issues over the past year, I took up smoking weed again for a while, with very little anxiety. A couple weeks ago, I smoked more than I usually did, so the set in was much more intense. Although it felt good, I noticed there was some anxiety building up in the back of my mind. I began to panic. But I decided to try just letting go, and accepting the reality of what was happening. No more anxiety, I was able to enjoy the drug.

The past summer there was quite pain free for her, but in the last 3-4 months her neck has been severely aching again, and after a recent long flight it has spread to her upper back as well. She has an appointment with a doctor about 10 days from now. Iâ€™m extremely close to her and she lives more than 8000 miles away from me. I feel helpless and anxious, and iâ€™m imagining all sorts of worst case scenarios :( 

If her MRI was clean 3 years ago, it canâ€™t be cancer or something now, even though the pain is worse, right? ",1

"I don't know what to do Ever since I got a ""stomach bug"" in september, I've had SIGNIFICANT problems with not just my stomach but everywhere. It started where I felt no appetite and gagged at the thought of food, along with a really bad taste in my mouth/rough feeling all throughout my mouth. That's where the problems began. After the days that followed I had HORRIBLE stomach problems, nausea and diarrhea. That lasted a few days before kind of subsiding. After it let I had a sitting feeling in my body that something is very wrong. I had weird cold symptoms and a ""sick"" feeling that I was an still am unable to describe. That lasted another week so I thought okay, it all must be over now surely right?
This is where the real problems began. The stomach problems came back in full force after a long period of having a gurgling feeling in my stomach and intestines. This is about a couple weeks after the first stomach bug so I imagine fairs fair people can have stomach bugs that come back for another round. That left and I was left with a near constant rumbling feeling in my intestines so I start to imagine it's IBS. Real problems began when I started feeling feverish every few nights and my sex drive greatly increased for some reason I can't explain, before giving way to more horrible stomach problems and diarrhea again. Now finally for the past month I've felt my mental state worsening and I'm starting to worry that I have bipolar due to me feeling tired and unable to do anything every few days then a cycle of feeling overly happy and my sex drive increasing. But something that I'm unable to reconcile with the bipolar theory is that at the end of it it's often accompanied by very real physical symptoms. This is turning into me rambling but my problems have become so bizarre yet serious that I'm unable to relate to other people's ""simple"" health anxiety where they worry about cancer or something easy to ""identify"" as a problem by themselves. I don't even know what I'm meant to worry about here. All I know is I feel awful reccuring stomach problems that are somehow accompanied by me feeling like I'm losing my mind when they begin. I'm so frustrated that it's become so hard to articulate my specific yet horrible problems.",1
"First time questions and help Sorry if I mess this up itâ€™s my first time posting on reddit and I need help.

A little bit of background :

When I was 16 I had a seizure caused by a perforated eardrum I was on a life support for two days.

Following my seizure I sort of got depressed and ended up putting on a lot of weight and never socialised with friends (only on games) I honestly left my house about 40 times in 6 years.

Five years ago my dad had a heart attack which left him on all sorts of medications and has a lasting effect on his heart.

In January 2017 my mum got diagnosed with oesophageal cancer they said they caught it early and she would survive but by the time march came she had gone from 55kg to 15kg all of the time me and my father was caring for her and watching her deteriorate. She died in the living room looking like which I can only describe as the worst thing Iâ€™ve ever seen other members of the family who was there said theyâ€™ve seen multiple people die of that horrible disease and my mums was the worst.

After my mum died I took over full time carer of my brother who had quadriplegic cerebral palsy, epilepsy , severe scoliosis a collapsed lung and can not communicate.

In 2018 around November I noticed a small lump on one of my testicles which caused me to be concerned and worry about it a lot, this was later cleared up by an ultrasound to be nothing thankfully.

Iâ€™ve been doing fine but recently over christmas an incident happened which I think may have broken? Me mentally. I know this seems trivial but I wanted a peaceful Christmas but my father invited my sister and her family for Christmas dinner and said he would cook, on Christmas Eve he says heâ€™s not cooking so I begin to panic I stayed up  all night cooking meats and making sure everything was perfect for when they arrived. When dinner was just about ready to be served I got the potatoes off the stove and went to empty the water now this thing was pretty heavy and I needed a hand to drain it correctly, I asked my sister to hold the lid so I could tilt the pan to drain. She said ok and I began to tilt the pan the lid cane flying off and all the potatoes went down the drain and was ruined. I can honestly say Iâ€™ve never felt anything like that moment in my life it felt like I stood still for an hour but in reality it was five seconds while my brain tried to process what the fuck just happened. Then it settled and I just lost it, I began crying and punching doors then went in to the room with my brother and just kept crying. For me as silly as it sounded Christmas was ruined I was down for like three or four days until I recovered mentally.


Then on New Yearâ€™s Eve my father had too much to drink and basically collapsed and smashed his head on to the floor ( I thought he was dead as he wasnâ€™t breathing for a solid 40 seconds) and didnâ€™t wake up for ten minutes.


Then January came and I had some sort of panic attack in which I couldnâ€™t breathe and it felt like my brain was frozen. Ambulance came did tests and said everything was fine I just thought I had a flu or something. Since then Iâ€™ve been in to hospital four times all of the time all the tests came back clear apart from an ecg which indicated there may be a slight problem. Doctor said he was 90% happy for me to go home and asked me do I have stress at home which I then told him about my mum etc and then he put it down to stress/ anxiety.


My height is 6 ft 1 and 145kg (really fat)


Since going to the hospital I canâ€™t stop thinking I have something wrong with me every little thing I google comes up with cancer or some sort of brain disease, I had heartburn recently so the doctor prescribed me omezaprole/prose to combat it as well as setraline/Zoloft or my anxiety. Iâ€™ve had what can only be described as â€œthe rattlesâ€ and havenâ€™t felt like eating at all which is making me feel worse than ever. Does anyone have these symptoms?


Whole body shakes and feels cold
A cough that bring up phlegm sometimes 
Back pain and rib pain 
Cold hands and feet 
Trouble sleeping 
Constipation
When I breathe it feels like Iâ€™m wheezing  or my stomach is gurgling


Honestly Iâ€™m at wits end and my doctor keeps saying nothing is wrong just wanted a bit of insight to some of you anxiety veterans.

Iâ€™m also really scared to take setraline as the side effects look horrendous. Thanks guys !

"So...anybody with intrusive fears about specific body parts being injured? Feeling a little down right now, so I figured I might as well lurk out of the shadows and find if thereâ€™s anybody dealing with similar stuff.

For something like 2.5 years Iâ€™ve been dealing with recurring and everyday fear of having my ears and eyes (yes itâ€™s that specific) damaged. Incomplete list of stuff I fear:

\- lasers (big one), yes in every shop as well

\- hands - mine and other people

\- cigarettes

\- gestures (hugging, patting, even walking to fast)

\- knives

\- forks (even when eating by myself)

\- every sharp corner

\- barbed wire

\- loud sounds

\- other bright lights

\- list goes on and on

&amp;#x200B;

I cannot help myself but look for dangers around me, spot them, and if I feel that something might have happened, I seek reassurance - either by somehow â€œrepeatingâ€ the thing or googling stuff or asking others if they hit me. I somehow think I know that nothing happened or couldnâ€™t have happened but I still cannot let it go for some time after the trigger and in the worst cases cannot let it go for a day or something. There are multiple episodes every day resulting in my every day being disturbed, being avoiding and distant (pubs are so distressing...). The weird part is that I do get physical sensations - for example right now I feel slight pain in my ear and a pressure because somebody patted me quite abruptly on the shoulder. I know theyâ€™re not real but they feed my anxiety and worrying.

Iâ€™m on 20mg of paroxetine itâ€™s helped somehow but not significantly. Looking into psychotherapy options right now.

Is there anybody else with similar issues? How youâ€™re doing? Whatâ€™s your story?

And it goes without saying crossed fingers for everybody struggling here on this sub - and even though i donâ€™t post often thanks for this community!

(Just as I was writing this I remembered thereâ€™s a grocery store at this street and now I worry if I didnâ€™t see a laser from it by peripheral vision. Yay me.)",1
"Worried about lymph node but it also may just be a ingrown hair cyst I think its been there for awhile but I could be wrong, I just know I've fixated on it this past week. Its located right above my right testicle, and it feels hard and doesn't move. its probably between 1-2cm and I can't tell if its a cyst as the hair there does look a little red by the root.

"Need some Help, Was doing so good too. Hey guys! I was doing so good, it had been weeks that I had finally got over my HA for the most part. However, today, I went down the anxiety spiral again. I was itching my back and decided to look at my moles since they seemed to be itchy. Nothing too crazy just a few itches. I've read about melanoma before and kind of disregarded it because although I have a good 60+ moles none of them showed signs of melanoma. Recently I have been getting some new moles, which isn't that crazy in itself but there seemed to be a lot more popping up. So anyway I unfortunately got on the Google and did some research on different types of melanoma and what to look for than preceded to check myself. I noticed two somewhat suspect moles. One is slight red/brown and the other one appears to be a kinda line. I read that linear melanoma are of the types and it looks a little similar. I'm freaking out because I don't have health insurance, and don't think I can pay for a dermatologist out of pocket since I'm somewhat young and on a fixed income. Any advice on how I can handle this or anything I can do to ease my anxieties?",1
"Just found this sub and so thankful Iâ€™m not alone with my delusions. Iâ€™ve had health anxiety my entire life. Iâ€™ve had every type of cancer you can imagine, diabetes, all the syndromes, etc.

"Fitbit heart monitor is terrible for my health anxiety. I had a panic attack in Oct.  It lasted for 12 hours.  I ended up in the emergency room.  Had blood work, ECG, and chest xray.  Everything came back good.  In fact I wasn't even worried I could have a heart condition until I was checked for it.  

After that I was convinced something was wrong with my brain.  I thought I had a brain tumor, stroke, etc.  After a while I calmed down on that, still going to see a neurologist though, because I suffer from a swaying dizziness when I'm anxious.

Now I'm obsessed about my heart.  I got a fitbit for my birthday and I religiously check my heart rate all day long.  Checking it makes it spike.  If I'm resting I can usually get it down to the 60s, but if I keep checking it it spikes up in the 90s.  When walking around it ranges from (had palpitations typing this) 110-140 depending on how anxious I am.  If I don't look at it it goes down, if I do man oh man does it rise.  During a panic attack it was 150.  I sat down and calmed myself down and it dropped to 100.  Blahhhhh.",1

I run marathons - eat well, take care of myself. I have not run in 2 months because my heart rate going up was freaking me out.
I have been to been to psychiatrist - emd helped but came back.  I have always resisted drugs because the thought of taking medicine made me more anxious.
Cut back to hospital - gave me xanax - I calmed down. EKG - Blood Work - Chest x-ray - nothing wrong go home.
Doctor gave me 10 Xanax just in case - woke up the next day anxious - took a pill (I hate drugs and for years wouldn't even consider it)  
I felt amazing all day - never had any anxious thoughts. Took another yesterday morning - same thing - all day no thoughts at all.  That is my best 2 days in 27 years - I felt normal.  It does make me sleepy and I see my psychiatrist  for the first time in 2 years tonight and I am going to ask what my best med treatment is.

"Head pain!!!!!! Someone please help..... For the past three weeks I have been experiencing the strangest head pains ever. Shooting pains around my head that move around and are different each time (sometimes its the same spot-not always) A lot of it occurs behind my ears as well.  The head pain is debilitating when it comes on, feels like iâ€™m being stabbed in the head (but at the same time is kind of dull) Its a pulsating feeling and doesnâ€™t normally last that long. This is happening every single day- No exaggeration and has sometimes been accompanied by a dull â€œnormalâ€ headache. I went to the ER, they took a regular CT and said it was normal. 
The head pain will come suddenly, last a few minutes and then (most of the time go) however one night i had a pulsating dull stabbing pain for about an hour....
I took a Tylenol and It eventually went away until about 9 hours later when the aching pain returned.  I havenâ€™t ever experienced headaches or pain like this.. and its every day for weeks now...I am also getting weird sensations all around my head like burning pains and hot/cold pains aswell. 

I do have health anxiety and have experienced shooting like pains in my head from panic attacks, however this is not the same thing. These are real headaches unfortunately...

because of these symptoms though, I have convinced and self diagnosed myself with a brain aneurysm thats about to rupture at any given moment.  this is the worst part. I have no history of brain aneurysms in my bloodline, but somehow have convinced myself I have one. I know I had a normal CT , and that reassured me a bit but then i read somewhere they arenâ€™t always caught and you need to have a CT with dye to catch them. (cue the anxiety again) 

I just want to know what these types of pains can come from? I donâ€™t understand.....any ideas? and any ideas on how to cop with this/has anyone else ever been afraid of this? 
ugh. It sends me into a full blown panic attack when i get this headache now which basically means im anxious all day everyday. 
 
Im tired of being so scared and bracing to drop dead every time i get a head pain... help!!!

"Doctor doesn't know what's wrong/MRI canceled:( Over the past month I've experienced pulsatile tinnitus in one ear along with ear and headaches.

"Convinced myself I have Huntington's disease The rational side of me knows that these symptoms have either been there for a while or they can easily be explained by any number of other less serious causes. Not to mention that as far as I know, *no one in my family has this disease.*

I was reading about Lewy body dementia and someone had described it as being a mix of Parkinson's, dementia, and Huntington's, the last of which I'd never heard of. So I went to learn about it and since I'm me, I started drawing parallels between the symptoms and things I've either been experiencing or that I wasn't experiencing until they were suggested.

Firstly, I'm in the typical age range when symptoms manifest. My confusion, occasional inability to understand things, indecisiveness, occasional problems with concentration, forgetfulness and fatigue must be due to this disease, not because I never get enough sleep. My bouts of dizziness/vertigo are the coordination problems, even though they're most likely a mix of exhaustion and severe tension headaches. I've noticed lately my index finger on my right hand sometimes twitches when I hold it just right on my mouse, never mind the fact that I've had that happen before with other parts of me if I position myself a certain way. Fidgeting must be a symptom too, even though I've fidgeted my WHOLE LIFE. Me being freezing cold must be the telltale tremors! And the anxiety and depression I've had for what feels like forever MUST be Huntington's too, right? Muscle stiffness can't possibly be due to me being out of shape! My inability to remember a word now and again or have words come out coherently must be from illness and not the fact that my brain to mouth filter has always been haywire. I have issues swallowing and breathing that *could* be due to Huntington's... or, you know, the esophagus problems I've been having.

Also read that one possible symptom is ""visual disturbances"" and lately I've been experiencing what looks like rippling water in my left eye. I realize that could be any number of things and generally as long as my vision itself is okay, it's nothing major. But if I was thinking rationally, I wouldn't be posting here.

And while the disease seems to be hereditary, all I had to do was read something about how only a majority of cases are inherited, implying that some people (1%-3% of cases) can still develop it even with no family history.

Not to mention that practically all these symptoms can be caused by *ANXIETY* too. Never mind I had a CT about a year ago (when many of these same things were happening) that was normal. Never mind it's rare (something like 15,000 people in the entire US have it). NOPE, must be Huntington's!",1
"Shortness of breath for only seconds at a time.. For as long as I can remember Iâ€™ve been getting these weird feelings in my chest that feel like I completely lose my breath. It only lasts for about 10 seconds then stops, but itâ€™s a STRONG sensation. It feels like when you jump into extremely cold water and it takes your breath away- except Iâ€™m always just sitting there doing nothing when it hits. I always related it to sinus problems or allergies, but Iâ€™m not having issues with any of that right now and the issue is worsening. It happens like 2 to 3 times a day now. I seriously donâ€™t know if this just random panic attacks hitting, or a heart or lung issue?? Iâ€™m convinced Iâ€™m dying but I canâ€™t afford to go to the dr right now, let alone an emergency dr. I feel like it canâ€™t be panic attacks if it happens when Iâ€™m in a perfectly good mood. Sometimes Iâ€™ll be sitting at my computer at work... sometimes Iâ€™ll be putting my son to bed... itâ€™s just random. But the feeling is making my anxiety 100 times worse and for the whole month of January Iâ€™ve basically had crippling anxiety from it. Not even in the food to function anymore. Iâ€™m over it.

"Rewilding Helped Me Beat Health Anxiety Hey guys, my personal experience with health anxiety came from seemingly nowhere. One day I had chest pain, and then every day for months after that I dug myself deep into this dark chasm that is health anxiety. At my lowest, I was up till 4 am on WedMD every night, almost got fired from my job, and most importantly - living in chronic PHYSICAL pain.   


The TLDR of my story is that rather than seeking ""comfort"" (hot baths, heating pads, painkillers), I began to seek ""discomfort"" and that led me to what I now understand as ""rewilding"".   


Basically, you are reaffirming your body how strong and capable you really are, by exposing yourself to elements that we humans previously had to deal with constantly....long before the days of anxiety lol.   


Take some cold showers. Go out into the elements for at least 20 minutes a day. Develop a deeper relationship with your breath.   


If anyone is interested in more information on this, I'll happily write an article, but I'm not an expert, just a practitioner. The man responsible for the term is [Daniel Vitalis](http://www.danielvitalis.com/rewild-yourself-podcast/).   


But there are others doing similar stuff, such as Wim Hof.   


Reaffirming to myself that I am strong was the only thing that pulled me out, and it started with seeking discomfort, learning some stoicism, and severing the emotional attachment I had to my physical symptoms. You can do it too.

"Dry Skin This might be better suited for r/anxiety in general, but since my anxiety seems to be health anxiety I figured I'd start here.  As a background, I've never had an anxiety/stress issue prior to September, but Labor Day weekend I had what I now know was a panic attack that sent me to the ER.  Since then I've been convinced of heart disease, brain tumor, diabetes and have been under constant stress the entire time with every single thought it seems being dedicated to why I feel the way I do.  MRI, ultrasounds, EKG, stress test, blood work all comes back clean and my doctor just tells me it's stress/anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

The last few weeks I have had ridiculously dry skin which I have never had before.  I saw my doctor last week and again he said it's just stress and none of my tests have been out of the ordinary to suggest otherwise.  He started me on Celexa (this week has been a roller coaster of suck, but I'm hopeful) for anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone dealt with chronic dry skin as a result of anxiety?  If so, what was your best way to help?  I know clearing stress/anxiety, meditating, etc., but I'm thinking more of the immediate while I work on ""me"".  It's hard to break the anxiety cycle when every time I touch something or move my skin hurts.",1

I still felt like I needed to get checked for this so I went dr had ordered a lumbar spine mri and come to find out they did the quick results where they tell em what was wrong until my dr calls or I go in to go over the results more in detail and of course I have a bulging disc in my back as well as arthritis ðŸ™„ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜

"Either I'm a hypochondriac or I'm on my way to being a statistic- unbiased advice needed Content warning for some gross-er medical stuff i guess

&amp;#x200B;

So, i'm here because i can't honestly tell if the situation im in is entirely in my head. Short background, in august 2018 .i had some fatigue, joint pain, intestinal issues and i had missed my period 2 months straight so i went to the dr and after bloodwork they determined i had hyperthyroidism and a positive ANA. They also found my sed rate to be elevated slightly and my CRP was around 7. 5 months of doctors visits, a loose diagnosis of thyroiditis (after my levels went from hyper to hypo), and then normalized blood work (back in normal range for thyroid and ANA). I basically get a clean bill of health, all my bloodwork looks good. Except my symptoms worsened. My anxiety and depression also got worse which is why im wondering if im just manifesting symptoms because of my mental health

&amp;#x200B;

The symptoms i had that were strongly associated with thyroid have mostly gone away except for the fatigue, but now new stuff is popping up. For the past month i've been having period problems, abdominal pain and gastro problems. 

I had a normal period in the last week of december, but then 2 weeks later i had 6 days straight of weird heavy spotting. throughout this time (technically since august actually) i was having diarrhea every morning without fail, and intermittent constipation. it came with abdominal cramping and severe nausea that goes away after i use the bathroom. I also completely lost my appetite and was having really strong nausea almost daily. I had stretches of days where i just couldn't bring myself to eat despite being super hungry, it just made my stomach turn. Despite eating less than i usually do, /and/ the fact that i usually lose weight really fast when restricting calories, I've been gaining weight and my stomach has grown so big i can barely fit into my pants. Shortness of breath has become a weird problem too. idk if its related. ive always been bad at breathing but i get winded getting off the bed to use the bathroom. laying down on my back makes me feel like i cant breath too.

Yesterday i went to the ER because since about 1/12 i've been getting really intense sharp/twisting pain in my lower left and lower right abdomen as well as a general dull ache right above my groin. The stabbing comes and goes, sometimes there will be 1-2 min stretches where it is extremely painful/waves of stabbing pain but then i wont feel it for another few hours. I recently looked down and realized the left side of my stomach is bulging out a little farther than the right side. Its hard to tell, as i have a softer stomach anyway. I was supposed to get my period on 1/25 i believe, but instead i had spotting the whole week and then on 1/28 during one of my classes i got horrific lower back pain and strong cramps. I had severe nausea and the pain was so bad i nearly cried. And yet, still only occasional light spotting. This is highly unusual for me as i usually have very light and painless periods with only moderate cramping *exactly* when i start bleeding. I took tons of painkillers and fell asleep but woke up in just as much pain and still hadnt started bleeding. So i went to the ER the next morning

They did an internal ultrasound, bloodwork and a urine test. The blood and urine came back mostly fine. They confirmed that my thyroid levels were normal, and my liver and kidneys are in good order. Lymphocytes are a bit low, globulin a bit high, and in the urine test they picked up some protein and blood but they assumed that was from traces of the spotting i was experiencing. The ultrasound found that my ovaries and uterus look ""unremarkable"". There were ""small follicles"" present, as well as evidence that a cyst may have ruptured on the right ovary and there was a small amount of free floating fluid. Shortly before i left, i started bleeding normally as well. I was surprised honestly. Looking down and seeing how bloated i am and feeling the immense pain on my left all the time, i really expected them to find something. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm still in immense pain and i'm confused. This all set off alarm bells in my head. i tried to brush it off for a long time but the pain just got worse and worse. I'm gonna obviously wait out my period and see if the pain persists after. I have a CT scan scheduled (ordered by the dr on my campus, i had gone to her about the pain a few weeks before the er thing happened) for feb 9th but it costs $3k for me..

"Obsessive about heart rate + chewing tobacco At night my heart rate has been in the 60s, slowly trying to quit chewing tobacco but recently started worrying that my heart rate is too slow especially since I just put a dip in and that is supposed to elevate heartrate and blood pressure but my heart rate is still in the 60s to 70s range scared I'm always in heart failure... literally laying here thinking my heart is failing and scared to call 911 because of many false alarms in the past that lead me to call 911 about 4 times in 2 weeks only once taken to a hospital where they wanted me to stay inpatient but with agoraphobia and panic attacks I was too uncomfortable with the idea of being locked up away from home and no way of getting out before a 3 day stay... feeling depressed and hopeless and that I'm gonna mistake a real heart attack for a panic attack or just write it off as my body being calm from meds I take... idk just don't have anyone to talk to about this especially at night 9pm where I'm at...",1
"Can glandular fever cause problems years later? I contracted a bad case of glandular fever when I was 14, and was in hospital for a couple of months, on an IV, and even had to use a wheelchair as I lost so much weight. It took me four months to go back to school full time due to being so exhausted all of the time. Before all of that, I was mostly healthy, maybe a bit underweight and had an underactive thyroid, but I was healthy. It was also around this time that I began struggling with manic depression and anxiety, which I am now medicated for.

Iâ€™m now 19, and my thyroid has began working normally again but I am constantly ill. I have colds at least once a month, if theres a flu going round I catch it, despite my best efforts to keep up with the preventative measures. I had 7 chest infections last year. 7. I recently was hospitalised for a kidney infection, then haemorrhaging ovarian cysts, and iâ€™ve just been diagnosed with ANOTHER kidney infection just three months after the last one. Everything else (Iâ€™m told) by doctors is healthy, Iâ€™ve had blood and urinary tests, ultrasounds and countless antibiotics and multivitamins. In addition to these other symptoms Iâ€™ve developed psoriasis and my hair is falling out, and Iâ€™ve also lost most of my toenails. Iâ€™m beginning to get embarrassed about being ill so often, and that people might think Iâ€™m making it up.

I canâ€™t help thinking this is all somehow linked to developing glandular fever. I know its possible to have long term ME afterwards, but I was wondering if anyone has a similar story regarding this?? Ive been to countless doctors about the various symptoms but none have gotten any better. Ive gotten so frustrated I have started to keep track of when Iâ€™m ill/ what symptoms I have and theyâ€™ve began to link together... In my mind my immune system has been seriously compromised since that time and I canâ€™t think of any other reason why. ",1

"The third appointment in a row where I have not been examined So I am well known to my gp practice recently due to a lot of issues with depression and anxiety. Long story short I wasn't fit to work and was very much suffering on the antidepressant that I had been put on. I was suicidal and close to the edge, having panic attacks on the daily etc. I have since come off the antidepressant and it has been thw best decision I have ever made for myself. The anxiety is still there (and always has been and I suspect always will be) but I am functional again - I couldn't even open my work email or answer an unexpected knock on the door without risking a panic attack and now I'm back at work.

In the last month I have been experiencing intermittent, stabbing, shooting pains. I have a history of chronic muscle tightness and pain. I am currently in physio for trapezius and neck pain, I also have mid-back tightness. I have previously had my legs in casts and afterwards splints to manipulate my calves into the correct position. I know what a muscle cramp feels like. I know what a pulled muscle feels like. I know what a muscle spasm feels like. I know what DOMs feels like. This new pain is on another level and it is vastly different in nature. I can't sleep, I can't lie comfortably, I can't concentrate properly, I will involuntarily have to change position and grab the effected limb when the pain comes on.
The pains that I am experiencing are not in the usual suspects of my calves or back/neck but in my groin/armpit/side/back of my thigh and glute area/ankle/elbow. My Google history is looking pretty crazy as a result. 

I have seen three different doctors at my gp practice about this because I am extremely distressed. Not one of them has examined me. All that has happened is that I have been counselled about psychosomatic symptoms being a thing and encouraged to get back on antidepressants. I feel like nobody is taking me seriously and this being the UK GPs are very much the gatekeepers to other services. While I would be willing to pay for answers if it comes to it I wouldn't even know where to start because I have no idea what could be causing all this. I'm crying as I'm typing right now from a stabbing pain in my groin. I just cannot believe that it's all in my head when my mental health is so much better now than it was. ",1

My fear isn't that ""hospitals are crazy"" but if my doctor says I'm basically ok I won't believe them. I'm hoping this basically cures my health anxiety, but I know that a lot of people with HA don't believe the doctor...

"I somatized fever. One thing I never thought I could have is a ""fake fever"". Fever is your body fighting with different harmful organisms, so it's doing good by doing bad. All fevers must be real, right? Maybe.

I was so afraid of Dengue Fever after a mosquito bite I had that it was driving me insane. I was literally counting days and hours until the certain first symptoms. I had it once, and fever it spikes out of nowhere up to 40Âº degrees, for days, basically destroying you. 

So, in the past week I was just waiting for fever come. It was an evening, and I started to feel my legs, arms and face really hot and weak. Panic attacks followed and I was constantly taking my temperature. It went from 36,4Âº, 37,3Âº, 37,5Âº but never above. I kept having this for 5 days in a row, until it finally stopped after going to the ER. If I payed attention to something else, it'd cease for a while.

"Numbness sensation on chest around heart after waking up once in a while - please... does anyone else experience this? So this is seriously at risk of ruining my day after doing so well for so long, so I'll try keep it brief.

I read an article about snoring and sleep apnoea last night - according to everyone who's ever slept in a room with me, I do snore heavily, but don't have sleep apnoea.

But this article I read said that even snoring is bad for you, and I got freaked out. I wake up sometimes with dead or asleep arms, making me think there's something seriously wrong with my heart and circulation, though my fiance convinced me this is just cause I move my arms to weird positions and the circulation gets cut off temporarily.

But something my fiance can't talk me down from is the fact that sometimes I wake up with red indents/marks all over my body, along with like a numbness or asleep feeling around my lower chest on the left side, stretching around to my side. 

The thing is I can only ever remember this happening on the left side - I.e. where the heart is, but I'm always very groggy when this happens so maybe it does happen on the right and I don't take notice? I only bring it up because it happened recently. The sensation goes away within 10 minutes or so.

Has anyone else ever experienced this? It only ever happens when I am in very deep sleep, having very vivid dreams and then wake up suddenly.

"Fear of Brain Aneurysm presenting as Headaches and Pulsatile Tinnitus So for the last five years or so i (26m) have had some various symptoms that i am not sure are simply me being aware of them or something much greater. In particular I experience Pulsatile Tinnitus, where i can clearly hear my heartbeat thumping in my left ear much greater than my right. Exertion makes it much more noticeable. Occasionally I also experience mild to moderate headaches that seem to follow a distinct line from the back of my skull to right behind my left eye. Some mornings, if i sleep on my left side, I will wake up with a headache on the left side of my head that throbs in time with my heart, and laughing/sneezing/straining can create a very -weird- sensation in that same area behind my left eye. I don't know if i could describe it but to my HA-addled brain it seems like what you'd feel if you had a ballooned vein suddenly swell slightly.

I also have been experiencing a slight visual disturbance in the left eye where lights and bright objects have a small, shimmery 'smear' above or below them, hardly noticeable unless I'm looking for it but still strange. I know symptomatic unruptured aneurysms can cause double vision but this seems to minor that I couldn't trust whether or not this is what 'double vision' entails. I have 20/20 vision, don't smoke, drink, or do drugs, no family history of aneurysms to my knowledge (my grandmother did die of a stroke; she was 86 though). I did have a MRI done when i first encountered these symptoms about 5 years ago and they found nothing; the visual disturbance was there during that time but I'm unaware if the pulsatile tinnitus was.

I've had a long, bloody history with Health Anxiety and I'm reaching out to you guys to finally admit that i've got a worrying problem. Can anyone shed light on if my fears are justified?",1

8 months ago I had a viral infection which has since caused whatever chronic condition or disease I have.

\-Just want to add, my viral infection started with a bad stomach/lower abdomen ache 1-2 days before the actual infection (8 months ago), and I had a rapid heart-rate from right at the start of the viral infection.

My symptoms are:

\-Just want to start off by saying my heart-rate was high right from the very start of whatever infection i got, like from day 1.

\-Tachycardia through-out the day. Little things make my heart race (whereas before I was very fit), I wear a fit-bit and my heart-rate is very normal in the 60s when I am sleeping. But in the day time, when I am out, even if I am just seating my heart-rate is constantly around 110 BPM. And if I have anxiety it can easily go up to 140. And if I, for example, climb the stairs or jump around a bit, my heart-rate shoots up to 150, and if I go for a short jog (I can't because of my heart), but in 1 minute it is nearly 180 BPM. Due to how fast it beats I do not take part in any exercise. I had normal Echocardiogram, and EKG.. but I did that 5 months ago. I want to point out, for some reason when I am with my family at home my heart-rate is also normal if I am just seating. And it was also normal when I visited my cousins and when I was in their house, again just sitting.

Recently I had to attend a science lab for my university, and even though I was sitting my heart-rate was consistently around 110-125.

\-My systolic blood pressure has been evaluated since this chronic condition.. at 130-140, but my diastolic pressure has remained 80.

\-Lately, my chest feels more pressure and stress, and I think its because I put alot of strain on my heart throughout the duration of this whole thing. I visited a cardiologist 5 months ago and he said my heart everything was good.

\-For the past few days, it feels if I breath in very deeply my heart hurts, but not really sure where the pain is coming from

\-My only blood abnormality is a very high B12 at more than double the upper limit, 1476 pmol/L. I have measured homocysteine just now, and it was in the normal range at 9 umol/L. Not really sure why my B12 is very high, as I am not taking supplements and am a vegetarian.

My hands (for nearly 8 months) have blue veins appearing on the finger. very similar to the hand in this photo (but on the finger as-well): [https://imgur.com/a/n5V1XjC](https://imgur.com/a/n5V1XjC) .

\- I had muscle twitching and tingling which happened alot through-out the day, it has since gone down, but the tingling and twitching still happen at times. I had a normal EMG.

\- Leg muscles have gotten much weaker according to my wall-sit time and squatting. Prior to 8 months I could easily do a wall sit for 3 minutes, now after 20 seconds my legs feel unbearably sore, and they are shaking like crazy right away when I start a wall sit.

NORMAL TESTS AND RESULTS (all this are from several months ago, except the blood results posted above, those are from today. ): Normal: TSH, Blood CBC, LDH, ESR, CRP, PROTEIN ELECTROPHORESIS, abdomen ultrasound , Echocardiogram, EMG test, urine analysis, EBV, bicarbonate, chloride, creatinine , AST/ ALT, Potassium.

ABNORMAL RESULTS: Very high Blood B12: 1475 pmol/L (range is 200-600 pmol/L). Slightly low Iron and Vitamin D. I do NOT take any B12 supps when it was measured high, and I am also a vegetarian.

To summarize: I feel I have some type of post-viral autoimmune disease which causes High B12, Tachycardia, anxiety, and high-normal Neutrophils and monocytes. But I really have no idea what it is, or if it is even an autoimmune disease, etc.

"Today's health anxiety level: shakily taking temperature with a meat thermometer because I couldn't find a human one Today I'd felt pretty okay honestly. Minus my usual stressed out-ness, a mini depressive episode, and being upset I slept in late, it'd be a pretty solid day!

&amp;#x200B;

That is, until the little voice in my head going ""hey you should google some symptoms, you know, its probably just a cold but just to be sure."" So I looked up the fact I've been experiencing flushing in my face, and decided that ""oh god it might be rosacea, oh god what if its cushings"" before calming down and saying its probably normal. I noticed it wasn't just face flushing, my whole body felt warm, so I must have a fever, right? It makes sense, as I've been fighting off a cold for a while now. but then just to completely fuck up my day, my brain thought of that little key word that can send me spiraling: sepsis. I looked up the symptoms for sepsis for the millionth time in my life. I took my pulse by hand and it was 100, I took it using two different apps and it was always above 90. That was one check off the list. I couldn't check my blood pressure because I couldn't go get the machine without alerting my family to my weird behavior, but I didn't think I felt like I had low blood pressure at the moment, but do I even know what that feels like? What if this is what it feels like? I switched immediately to the next test I could try, my temperature. I know I've felt my skin warm to the touch, but I'm naturally someone who gives off a lot of heat, but the heat on my face and neck felt abnormal but I needed to know *how* abnormal, so I tore up the areas where we keep health stuff that I *could* tear up discretely and found no human thermometers. It then hit me that we have meat thermometers! A quick google search didn't really say if they'd be effective for taking usual under-the-tongue temperatures but I'm sure it would work anyway. I cleaned off a thermometer and stood in the mirror with it under my tongue so I could see the display. The numbers slowly kept creeping upwards and the suspense was throwing me into a panic, that I *must* have sepsis, but how did I get it? Oh gosh it must be the canker sore I noticed on that one part of my gums that have been swollen for a bit, that's it its because I don't brush my teeth after every meal bacteria from my teeth got into my blood and now I have *sepsis* and I'm going to ***die****.* And then the thermometer eventually plateau'd somewhere around 95.4 or so. And now I'm somewhat calmer but I just can't help still feeling *weary*. Writing this all out here though has sorta helped me illustrate to myself how ridiculous it has been, which is much better than I've handled the fear of having sepsis in the past! So wooo to me :)

"Am i a hypochondriac? I am a 24 year old female, and would like to preface this by saying that I do actually have a few chronic illnesses that have been diagnosed, one of which is an autoimmune deficiency. As well as severe anxiety with frequent panic attacks. 

 That being said, for years now I have been hyper focused on various symptoms my body has displayed that usually end with them disappearing and me forgetting they ever happened.  But with every pain or nausea episode I have, I end up spending hours googling symptoms and what they mean.  For years now I have put in anywhere from 2-8 hours a day on various medical websites. 

This week alone I have convinced myself that I have:
-ibs
-Crohn's
-breast cancer
-kidney failure
-pregnacy
-kidney stones
-patellafemoral syndrome
-worms
-diabetic ketoacidosis
-an impending heart attack

I am seriously petrified of what could come up in any blood work that is done. I am worried that Iâ€™ll find out Iâ€™m anemic because Iâ€™m losing blood somewhere (I fall asleep on the couch on occasion and it scares me). A new fear I also have is that I will faint when having blood drawn which has never happened before. Earlier this week I built up the courage to go to my allergist so that I could get an update on my meds, I start to tell him about my recent weight gain (from eating out all of the time and being careless with my diet). And he convinces me that there is something wrong with my thyroid from my Zoloft. I am just so frustrated because I want to rule everything out and make sure I know I am fine to get started on getting this dumb anxiety to go away. But I am scared. He didnâ€™t take my blood today but when I go see my Gyno in two weeks he wants me to. I am so nervous. Ugh help!! Has anyone else dealt with this.

Flash forward to now. Quit pills 4 years ago, quit weed 1.5 years ago, quit cigarettes a month ago and now only drink once or twice a week. HOWEVER. Since getting healthier and stopping substances, my body has freaked out and feels like complete garbage every day. I have constant heart palpitations, tingling and headaches. I've had ECGs, a brain CAT scan, MRI on my chest, lung x-ray, blood pressure monitor and numerous blood tests and literally they can't find anything wrong with me. I am sad because I feel worse now than I ever did during my party days, and according to doctors I am in great shape considering. Also go to the gym 3-4 days a week. But every day I wake up exhausted, with random pains, not able to focus, random sweating fits, weakness. Panic attacks at least once a week (in the ER 2+ times a month). Anyone else who used to be a crazy party animal have these issues after getting sober?? ",1
"would my may2018 ECG of picked this up? worried! so; yesterday I was drilling some wood and I out of nowhere felt a dul pain in my left arm and  chest, I think it was brought on by putting arm in or moving it in specific positions, and when I  took a breath, my left side of chest hurt! it went on like for a few seconds and the simptoms subsided  but sometimes if I take a deep breath or lay in some positions it hurts the arm or chest but if I  am just sitting still on my computer it doesn't hurt I read about silent hart attacks and this  caused me to have my anxiety spiral out of controle again! If there was anything wrong in my heart,  would it of showed up on my ECG or is it possible that this could be something new? I keep worrying  but I haven't let this whole thing keep me from enjoying my day. I had my ECG in may of 2018 when  my anxiety had spiraled out of controle over some palpitations that were 99.9% attributed  to eating too many of those chocolate easter eggs. What I notice from the new simptoms though, is  that the pains are very intermittent and come and go, like sometimes I will feel some chest pain if  I take a deep breath, sometimes if I raze my arm, or hold it a certen way, etc I was able to get a  good night's sleep but still worrying about the whole possibility of some undetected heart thing or  a potentially dangerous problem.

"Palms of hand acting strange! Photos: https://imgur.com/a/m9nXmwG

While I was in my mirror pinning clothing to be sewn my palm on my left hand started acting funny and I looked at it and it seems to look like itâ€™s swollen a bit. My right hand was doing that for a while + had a very random hyperextending thumb (which Iâ€™ve never had but now it bends back far whenever I hold it up). I also noticed the veins in my hands / body in general are extremely noticeable but I wasnâ€™t worried too much about that part as I am a pale person and none of them are varicose veins. I do have (shown in last photo) this pinched/swollen looking vein or tendon (no idea WHAT that is) a little below my index fingers that had shown up over the summer and that was what started health anxiety in my life to begin with. If anyone knows if it looks like something is actually off, I would appreciate any advice. Ofc going to a doctor is always the best bet but I am about to travel for a weekend out of country~I believed for a while that I may have carpal tunnel by the way my palms and some fingers have been acting. Thanks all! ",1
"Worried about my gallbladder.... I'm 25, 21 BMI, not super active but I've been good about eating whole foods and fiber though I've had a bad sugar habit.  I'm also on an oral contraceptive (tri-lo sprintec) and I cut my calories to 1,000 for a few weeks to lose weight. That, plus my irregular eating habits and tendencies to skip meals, puts me at risk for gallstones--I think.

Last Sunday I noticed I had some really sharp pains on my right side under my ribcage. This isn't totally abnormal, I have had this before, but this time it was much sharper and deeper than normal. It lasted like a minute or so and happened a few more times but it wasn't anything serious--just left me feeling a little chilly. But for whatever reason, my brain was immediately thinking ""that's gallbladder pains"" and I got worked up. For the rest of the week, I've been panicking every time i've had a pain or sensation in the area--which has been fairly often, making me wonder if it's psychosomatic or if something is actually wrong. I've had some pangs radiate into my shoulder and my arm as well, convincing me even more it's my gallbladder and not me panicking. TMI but I also had some considerable gas and bloating throughout the week, and I woke up more nauseous than normal most morning and I've had indigestion and stomach pains a bit after eating as well. I stopped eating stuff with a lot of fat and sugar in hopes that I wouldn't have an attack worse than what I experienced Sunday--in fact I cut out fat almost completely, I've been too afraid to eat it.

I went for a checkup on Thursday and my doctor ordered bloodtests and an ultrasound on my upper right quadrant. I haven't gotten the results yet, but I got a call from someone at the clinic a day after about information that ""my doctor wanted to share with me,"" but it went to voicemail and when I called back immediately after they never answered--just to add to my worry!

And now to add even more to my worry, my urine is darker than normal, which is another sign of gallbladder dysfunction I've read about...(though I did have beets for lunch)...

I've been panicking about this for an entire week, and I know it's nothing to really be stressed over...I've changed my diet as much as I could and I'm getting everything taken care of, but I'm terrified of having another attack or something awry happening in between now and my blood results/ultrasound. And I'm scared for many reasons of having my gallbladder out...I've never had major surgery and I've heard about chronic digestive issues people have after they get it removed...thought that definitely sounds better than having an infected gallbladder explode inside of you.

Just wanted to vent...I've had to keep myself off of the internet because I kept psyching myself out more and more (and I think it may have ended up giving me more symptoms). I've been so doom and gloom over this and I normally can convince myself to relax even when I'm worried about something being wrong with me, but this time I haven't been. Don't know if it's intuition or what.",1
"Really scared this is the start of something I've been having sinus issues for the last few weeks and its been driving me crazy with repeated hospital visits and I don't know what to do.

This January I got a middle ear infection from a flu or cold and after antibiotic treatment it went away and now I'm having pressure on my other ear that feels just the same and I'm worried its another ear infection. I've been googling non stop and I don't know what to do. I've been googling people who lost their hearing and are completely depressed and HIV related to sinus issues because I still have a runny nose all the time and maybe I'm undiagnosed for it. I'm worried that what if my immune system is failing because i have HIV, or cancer. Is this called stress... I don't know what is normal because I've been on edge for years now and I'm scared.

I don't know what to do. I go normal for a few days then in a state of panic for another month. Is this HIV should I be worried? What if its another ear infection I don't want to go deaf and be depressed for it !

"I think my ex might have given me something... I (22F) have been feeling really off lately. When I wake up I have a headache and I feel dizzy when I bend over. It also hurts to  swallow, which just went away today. I noticed today when I woke up I didn't have a headache nor was I dizzy, but right after I ate breakfast the dizziness and headache came back. Along with all of this, I also have very mild aches in my arms and hands from time to time. This has been happening since the 27th, so seven days overall. It has not been getting worse, but I notice my headaches get worse when I eat the breakfast food at my dining hall. (I'm a college student that lives on campus) I don't think its a cold because I'm not coughing or sneezing and I don't have a fever. I took a STI test yesterday just to rule out any possibility of me having anything and the results are coming back Monday, Tuesday at the latest. I had a boyfriend of 4 months who said he was clean but we still mostly used condoms. The first month we were dating the condom broke during sex and his semen got inside of me. This is what is making me freak out I have something and why I got tested. 

tldr: The past seven days i've had mild body aches, headaches with dizziness after I eat and sometimes right in the morning when I wake up. I'm freaking out that I might have HIV because the condom broke while I was having sex with my ex 6 months ago. (He told me he was clean but we still made it a habit to use condoms)",0
"Hypochondria buddies? -This is a repost.-

I go to the doctor in two weeks for my annual, so I know that will give me some answers. I'm wondering if its diabetes but my fasting glucose from last year was 82, but I'm not sure. I guess I'm wondering if dry mouth is a common symptom of anxiety, I'm not extra thirsty just feeling dry.",1

"I'm so scared because of chest pain :( I'm a 20 y/o female who's always had a high resting heart rate (80-115). I am currently on my period so it is possible it could be related to it but I'm not sure. I had a baby over a year ago and still have some milk, so I thought this might have something to do with the chest pain. I have a history of acid reflux, but I haven't noticed it in about 9 months. The only heart-related risk factors I know of is just that I'm anemic, vape, and that I'm about 35ish pounds overweight. The last 24-36 hours I've noticed some slight pain on the left side of my chest. It isn't that bad, it just feels like its slightly clenching and it makes me nearly have a panic attack everytime I notice it. I first noticed this happening the other night when I got extremely upset and my heart rate went pretty high. Do you think this is anxiety symptoms, breast pain, or actually heart pain?

Brain zaps/chills I started taking vitamin B12 a few weeks ago and I started getting brain zaps. I know they can be caused when coming off antidepressants but Iâ€™ve never been on them in my life.

I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever felt them before and I canâ€™t say B12 was the reason why but it all started a few days after taking B12 daily. Itâ€™s the worst feeling though and I wish it would go away. Even after stopping B12 they still happen now :( ,0
"How much to say when speaking with your doctor So I have an appointment with my GP tomorrow, which I have probably been putting off for too long (I feel like the more I see her, the less seriously she will take me).  I have symptoms that have lasted months (or in some cases years, only they've gotten worse), ones that have lasted weeks, and one that just started a few days ago.  When I scheduled the appointment, I listed the three most worrisome or annoying symptoms as the reason for going in.  My question is just... when I actually go to my appointment, should I read the dr my laundry list of symptoms, or should I just address what I scheduled the appointment for?  What do you do when you have many different symptoms?  I know that people can have multiple illnesses at once, but the fact that my symptoms are in a few different, probably unrelated areas makes me worry that my dr will just assume that *everything* is in my head (and yes, I'm aware that much of it could be all in my head).  I'm also worried that if I mention that all this feeling ill exacerbates my anxiety and that my anxiety exacerbates my feeling ill that she'll write me off as a nut case.

Tl;dr- I'm experiencing a lot of probably unrelated symptoms.  When I see my doctor, should I tell her ALL the symptoms I'm experiencing (and risk being taken less seriously), or just the most concerning ones?  What do you do?

"Had a Panic Attack Last Night. Strange Sensation in Head. Anyone Ever Experienced Something Like it Before? Sorry for making another post so quickly after my last one. But I'm in a bad spot right now and I just need to talk about what I'm going through.


:Last night, I had a weird sensation in the left side of my head, above the ear. It felt like something was throbbing or pulsating inside my head. It was never painful and it would go away for a few minutes before coming back. I felt it until I went to sleep (where I thought something was going to happen to me in the middle of the night or I would die in my sleep.)


It doesn't help that right now, my current paranoia is a brain tumor or a unruptured aneurysm. Earlier this week I had a headache above my left eye around my eyebrow but that went away after a few hours. I've been incredibly anxious about that side of my head.


I woke up this morning and haven't felt it again, though I've been a nervous wreck all day fearing it would return. It hasn't so far, but I think I'm having hypersensitivity in that region cause it feels a bit fuzzy right now.


Has anyone else felt something similar to this?

"Losing sleep over losing sleep I might have a stomach ulcer. Maybe, probably? I went to a doctor who said I might have an ulcer, but didn't do any tests. Two weeks later I went to an urgent care doctor because I had been up 30+ hours with discomfort and nausea. They did a blood test and said I was h. pylori negative, but I'd been on Prilosec for nearly two weeks and apparently that can affect the test outcome. Was told to keep taking the Prilosec. About a week later I went back to urgent care because I was still losing sleep over nausea. On three or four occasions I have woken up in the middle of the night overheated and needing to vomit, almost fainting in the process. I also have pretty consistent abdominal pain across the entirety of my abdomen, which worries me because Google says that I'd feel pain only in the middle. 

I have really bad anxiety and this health crisis has spiraled me into depression as well. I've changed my entire lifestyle in the last month over this--all I eat are carrots, potatoes, apples, peanut butter, and yogurt. All I drink is water.

SYMPTOMS

Left(just as much chance as the right) side of my chest has pain. It feels kind of internal and dull. It doesn't feel sharp. It comes and goes. 

I've been having these night shivers for two to three months now, where I shake uncontrollably in my legs and my feet start to sweat (sometimes hands not always). I feel better by deep breathing, but not shortness of breath, while going under the blanket to warm up. I also stick my stomach out and hold  an object against my stomach pushing into it. This happens I've noticed, when I smoke medical grade marijuana or have excessive sugar, like a unhealthy big cake slice and ice cream. It's to the point where I know when it will happen because I get a little light headed and don't feel myself and it will happen 3-5 minutes later. 

Recently, these chest pains have been occuring. I feel like I'm going to die. After it's over I just WANT to cry or die even if it's gone. 

I don't really get this from exercise. I can try again but I just ran up four flights of stairs and I feel it, but I don't have to sit down or breathe like I can't breathe. It hurts because I think about it! 

Neck pain sometimes but usually depends how I sleep. Back pain sometimes. Not really arm pain. 

My gf says no worth going to the doctor cause the bills. My dad says it's in my mind. Neither of them can physically feel what I'm feeling. As I'm typing this I'm fine but if I think about it it will come the way I explained (dull just a mild annoyance type of pain)

I'm fucking 23 and healthy. I dance, am vegetarian, sometimes work out and I really don't deserve this. It gets me SO MAD that this has randomly been happening where I'll punch my chest when it hurts just for the fact that I am so pissed off at myself for having this. It's ruining me mentally and I've always had very bad anxiety. I have panic attacks often now as well, around one a day and none if I'm lucky. I used to smoke marijuana a lot and nothing would happen, not even these panic attacks. I have recently started a career job but it's a very stressful one where I deal with public transportation and the crazyb commuters.  

Somebody please I beg to make me feel a little reassured!!!! My dad and his family have diabetes. Last time I went to the clinic three months ago, they said I was fine! No blood tests just the blood pressure arm band was used. Is this angina, anxiety, heart problems?? ",1
"My HIV Health Anxiety Nightmare I participated in a â€˜low riskâ€™ activity. It is estimated the chances of acquiring HIV are about 1 in 2,500. Nevertheless, it has happened. 

4.5 weeks later I got the flu. Cue health anxiety meltdown. 

I tested at 5.5 weeks. Negative. 3 other tests later. Negative. I have just ordered my final test at 12 weeks. I know itâ€™s probably unnecessary but I just need to do it to be able to move on. 

Funnily enough, this is happened before. 3 weeks after a risk where my doctor said that HIV transmission â€œjust doesnâ€™t happen this wayâ€, I absolutely freaked. Cue two negative tests and 1.5 years of worry and not fully believing I was HIV negative. 

I know better than anyone the toll this condition can have on you.

"Thinking I might have diverticulitis I don't really like trying to diagnose myself, but after living with this unique kind of pain for a few months now I'm trying to stay ""positive"" by considering other causes other than defaulting to my mindset that it's cancer.

I've been experiencing pain on and off in my lower-left abdomen. It ranges anywhere from an ache --  to a burning sensation depending on the day. When it first started happening it got so bad I couldn't sleep on that side. It seems to get worse when the waist-band on any of my pants puts pressure in that area.

I have already been to the doctor for this before and they took an ultrasound to make sure that it wasn't an ovarian cyst, but they found nothing. I also had a CT-Scan done in that region in July of last year when a kidney stone got lodged in my ureter tube, so they didn't find any anomalies in that area either (note, the pain in my left side only started happening around late November).

Eating out too much (greasy foods) or over-eating tends to exacerbate it more. 

I'm planning on making an appointment just as soon as my husband and I are approved for our on-site assistance program, but it might be another couple of weeks until we hear back from them.

I'm currently trying to see if limiting my intake to a healthy amount, drinking lots of water, and exercise helps any.

"Sudden Death at any Moment This is my first post on Reddit, so I am unfamiliar with things work, however I am here out of desperation.

Over a week ago, I smoked a THC vape pen, (a concentrated form of THC). I hadn't smoked weed in around a year and I generally do not like it. I felt nothing for around 10 minutes, then it all hit at once, and I became very nauseous, dizzy, began to sweat profuseley and breathe heavily, had a panic attack, and had to sit down to avoid passing out. 

I worried I was going to die. I now know that it was a normal reaction to way too much THC, called a greenout, and I recovered from most of the symptoms after a few days. However, while ""greening out"", I felt a strange pressure under the skin of my forehead, and apparently a red spot formed there temporarily.

Most of the symptoms went away. However, multiple times a day, I feel a light pressure in my forehead still, and a few days after that, it spread to feel like it was behind my right eye too. No pain, just a light pressure that gets worse with exercise. I also feel foggy and dizzy, and have ear ringing commonly.

I am here because I have an anxiety disorder, and have had major issues with health anxiety in the past, especially a fear of aneurysms. I forced myself to believe that my symptoms were a result of anxiety, but when they didn't go away, I went to the family doctor yesterday.

I explained things to the doctor, and he wasn't sure what to make of it. He said it was likely a tension headache, but, in his words, ""wanted me to get a CT scan to make sure it's nothing like an aneurysm"", though he highly doubted it.

That made my fears worse. An aneurysm is one of my greatest fears. Worse, I have to live with this fear for another week because they can't get me a CT scan until the 12th. The only thing preventing me from freaking out  totally is the unlikelihood that I would develop one. I'm a generally healthy non smoking 21 year old male with no known family history of this on either side. The symptoms, while they are strange, can seem like those of an aneurysm, but they're too unclear for me to be sure, and could be a number of things.

 I am keeping in mind my past experiences worrying about health anxiety that came to nothing, but it's hard to overcome my fears and symptoms. This past week I have spent in constant anxiety, and now I'm too afraid to even walk up the stairs or drink tea or anything that might raise my blood pressure, because it might rupture an aneurysm. I think constantly about my own death and have trouble sleeping and eating. I know this makes it worse, but I don't know what to do.

"Constant heart anxiety. Iâ€™ve been lurking on this sub for about two weeks. It all started one morning after shoveling heaps of snow and ice off of my car for about 40 minutes. I got to work and felt a distinct fluttery feeling in my chest several times over the course of an hour or two. That has subsided, but for the past two weeks Iâ€™ve had what I can only describe as a discomfort in my upper left chest that comes and goes. 

Iâ€™ve always been the person who googles every single symptom and constantly catastrophizes every situation. So after this incident Iâ€™ve monitored every ache and pain, every strange feeling, every random heartbeat that seems too strong or out of place. I am 31f, and I have many symptoms of acid reflux and also a great deal of general anxiety. It also doesnâ€™t help that I work on my feet moving and lifting things all day long so while I get in a healthy step count daily, my arms, shoulders, back, and legs are usually hurting one way or the other.

I am scheduling an appointment with my GP, but Iâ€™m hoping to find some reprieve from the constant googling, as well as the fueling of my anxiety caused by any minor, unfamiliar twinge in my body. Any advice is greatly appreciated!

"My IUD &amp; HA Hi all, I just wanted to put this story out there if any women are experiencing something similar.

&amp;#x200B;

5 1/2 years ago, I got a non-hormonal IUD put in (Paragard). Shortly after, my anxiety skyrocketed, and my spiral of hospital and doctor visits revolving around my HA started. I wondered if my IUD was triggering it, and I even went to my OB to get it taken out to which she scoffed at me and told me there was NO way my IUD was exacerbating my anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

FF to May of last year, and I get my IUD out. I go on a trip immediately afterwards, and my anxiety is high still because of travel. I get back and BOOM. My anxiety is down to a 2-4/10 verses the 6-9/10 that it had been for almost 6 years.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not saying go get your IUD ripped out, but just a reminder to be your own advocate and trust the way you feel. Just because ""no one"" has had those side effects to a medication/implant doesn't mean it's not happening.",1
"ALS Fear Sending My Life In A Downward Spiral. I don't know where to to turn other then to people who may be able to relate to me. Every second of the day lately I have it in my head that I am going to pass away from ALS shortly. 

It all started about 1 - 2 weeks ago. I started having muscle twitches in my right arm and right thigh, and when I bend over to pick something up or when I squat, my right thigh muscles twitch and tremor uncontrollably. A few google searches later, ""ALS"" is popping up all over the place. It's been a constant worry now with every 5 - 10 minutes me getting up out of my chair to ""test my strength"" in my right leg. But every time I squat or try to balance on my right leg and bend at the knee, the tremors and twitches trigger in my right thigh like crazy. I have really horrible HMO insurance and it takes anywhere from 3-5 weeks for me to see a Primary Care Physician. I have an appointment for 4 weeks from now with my PCP. But until then all I can do is sit back and hope for the best but expect the worst. 

I am in in a massive downward spiral now. I can't do anything but sit on my computer and research ALS. I don't want to go anywhere or do anything because in my head I want life to move as slowly as possible just incase I have not a lot of time left on this earth. I don't know where else to turn.

"I keep losing my ability to sneeze OK, this is a very bizarre one, but I've been suffering from this issue on and off for over two years, and it's having a big impact on my life.  It'd be great if someone is able to shed some light on this.  I keep losing the ability to sneeze.  Basically, I'll get to the ""ahh"", but the ""choo"" won't happen.  I'm not 100% sure, but I think it all started when I had some kind of allergic reaction to something in 2016, and I found myself unable to sneeze for at least three weeks.  During that time, I had quite bad headaches and head pressure.  When I finally sneezed, the pain instantly disappeared.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, the problem keeps coming back, along with the head pain/pressure I mentioned earlier.  I think the longest I've gone without sneezing naturally is three months.  Strangely, I can force myself to sneeze by tickling the inside of my nostrils with a pointy tissue, but that doesn't seem to relieve the head pain.  However, I can occasionally sneeze if I think about something erotic and fortunately that does relieve the head pain!

&amp;#x200B;

I've researched this problem countless times and I read somewhere that inability to sneeze could be the sign of a brain tumour, which seems very unlikely because I would also have more serious symptoms, such as an inability to yawn or swallow, which I can do perfectly fine.  Also, the fact that I'm able to FORCE myself to sneeze surely means there's nothing seriously wrong?

&amp;#x200B;

I also read that it could instead be a psychological problem, and I honestly think that could be right - sometimes, when I feel a sneeze coming on, it'll come out fine when I'm having a conversation with somebody, so it could be that it helps to be distracted from the sneeze instead of worrying about it.  I would also like to mention that looking at the light in my bedroom SOMETIMES makes the sneeze come out at the last second, despite the fact that I don't think I have the photic sneeze reflex (i.e. ability to sneeze without fail by looking at a bright light).

&amp;#x200B;

Plucking my nose hairs can also make me sneeze, but I tried that a few days ago and it didn't work.  Now I'm ""sneeze-stuck"" again.  Hoping someone can help!  Thanks.",1
"Heart ""jumping"" in chest and suspected PVC. Any advice? Hey guys,

For the last few days I've been having a hard time with a weird sensation in my chest. 

Four or five times a day, I'll have a feeling like my heart ""jumped"", or skipped and beat and compensated with one bigger beat to pump out more blood through my arteries. It feels horrible.

"Abdominal aorta anxiety I can strongly feel my abdominal aorta pulsating. Laying down and standing up. I did a mistake and googled it a few weeks ago and anxiety hit me hard. Even tho it said that aneurysm happens mostly to men over 65, I can't get this out of my mind.

I am skinny female in my 20's so I think this should be normal but my brain won't believe it.. I went to the doctor who didn't even examine me but just said ""I guess it's normal"". That didn't really help.

"Intestinal anxiety I'm a 27 year old male, I don't smoke in any capacity nor do I do any drugs or drink alcoholic drinks in any capacity. I'm not on any medications and have no pre existing illnesses.

Last year I had a pretty large bowel movement, large enough that I couldn't pass it without manipulating my anus with my hand to ease the log out, since then I've been having blood in my stools (on toilet paper and in/on feces), the blood is red, not sure if it's dark red but it's definitely not black. I have no pain associated with passing a stool at all which is slightly comforting I guess...

Shortly after the blood started showing up last year I took myself to the ER and explained what was happening, after getting a finger up my ass I was told it was most likely hemorrhoids. Not to long after visiting the ER the blood in my stool disappeared and I was relieved, now after roughly a year ish later it's shown up again and been off and on for about a month, still no pain associated with having bowel movements, just anxiety.

"Bone tumor I had been doing so well for a couple years up until recently. I've got a bony lump growing on my sternum over the last two months, with pain being present for the past 1.5 months. I had an x-ray, blood test, and CT scan. The lump is undoubtably growing and the pain is still there. All the scans and the blood test came back fine, the radiologist just noted a ""sternal notch"" and everything else was fine, there were no suggestions as to what it is or anything. 

My university doctor doesn't seem to know what it is and just said ""you may be producing extra cartilage right now. It might be one of these things where you'll have to wait up to 6-8 months for the pain to go away."" How is the pain supposed to go away if this bony lump is still growing and likely won't disappear without surgery?

I feel better with the radiologist not being suspicious of the lump, but I still feel uncomfortable because no one knows what it is yet and I feel like bone cancer is still kind of in the picture. My sternum/sternal joint pain is still here and it has been 1.5 months. I'm making an appointment with my real doctor back home to try and nail this shit down.

However I've been having chest pains/aches over the duration on the left, middle, and right side and specifically the last few days it's been like an ache on the left side of the chest.

"Health Anxiety? Random abdominal pain, scared of going to the doctor and potentially hearing worst case scenario Iâ€™ve had a LOT going on since Christmas. I lost my grandmother to cancer, Iâ€™ve been sick, had a panic attack, felt grief out of nowhere for the first time which included pains, random anxiety, and somewhat a fear of my own health. 

I had diverticulitis at the end of October last year and it was the first time I realized â€œoh wow. Iâ€™m not invincible and there are more things than stomach achesâ€

With all of this going on, Iâ€™ve also now started to feel a small pain around my gallbladder. It mainly happens when Iâ€™m readjusting my position, sitting uncomfortably, etc. it feels almost swollen and like Iâ€™m squishing it (Iâ€™m a bigger guy). Iâ€™ve read things online for relief hoping it was just gas or itâ€™d go away on its own. Itâ€™s definitely gotten better! When itâ€™s not hurting Iâ€™d feel a pain in my lower right, or on my left side. All of these pains are a 0-3 max on the pain scale. 

I canâ€™t decide if Iâ€™m just looking for something wrong, or if Iâ€™m having health anxiety. Iâ€™m just so scared to go to the doctor because I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever gone and heard good news. It feels like itâ€™s getting better over time, but I wonder if Iâ€™m over analyzing every pain or feeling I feel now.

I know I should go to the doctor, but Iâ€™m scared of going and hearing I have to have surgery, or if Iâ€™d hear (hopefully) â€œitâ€™s just irritated from a bad diet and lack of exercise. Lay off fatty foods and take 2 of these a day and youâ€™ll be all goodâ€",1

"Health Anxiety, what has worked for me - Hopefully it helps you I have health anxiety and it's taken me about 3 years to. It feels good to know that I am not crazy or feel like I am dying from cancer or having a stroke or whatever else it can be. The symptoms are all over the place one month it will be numb limbs, the next month my face feels tingly, the next month I have shortness of breath, then the next month is muscle cramps, the next is heart palpitations. Each time I   I've been to the doctor so many times its kind of silly. Here are some ways I cope with it. I have days where it's gone, mild days, and days where it's an episode. I am glad I found this group because it makes me feel like I am not alone. It's hard to talk with people about your health anxiety because most people don't understand. I think it's fine for people to not understand we all 

1. I see a CBT therapist 
2. I channel my thoughts into something creative (painting, woodworking, reading, writing, drawing etc.) 
3. I keep a journal about the symptoms/day to day occurrences 
4. I listen to classical/calming music before bed 
5. I allow myself to worry for an hour a day
6. In the morning for about 10 minutes, I tell myself I am healthy, people love me, and today will be great, you will be ok. 
7. I laugh/talk about it with my friends (not for everyone but it helps me to know that some people have health anxiety at a mild level)
8. I note all of the things that happened that have made me feel better and then I repeat them, in addition I also write down all of the things that made me feel bad and try to articulate why that make me feel bad.
9. Little to no Caffeine, I love coffee but limit myself to drinking coffee on good days. As coffee can sometimes really amplify my symptoms.  
10. Little to no alcohol, I limit my alcohol intake to social events and never drink on weekdays. I noticed that alcohol while it suppresses my symptoms it makes me into a monster emotionally, so I only drink when I am having a good day and not worried about anything. 
11. Find a hobby. I like to sail, a hobby that requires concentration around the boat and everyone on the boat it helps me be mindful of my surroundings. It's something that has me forget about the symptoms because there is no time. This one took me about a year but I am glad I invested my time into it. 

This list is a work in progress, my recovery has been slow and each month I set a small goal for myself. In the midst of the anxiety it's important to realize that recovery and healing take time it will never happen overnight and I think understanding this and setting very small goals has really helped me. My list above is months of testing out different methods to see what worked for me. Just remind yourself it takes time, you are not alone. ",1

"Mitral valve prolapse, anxiety or something else causing these symptoms? Ok so I've been having some issues with my heart for about 6 years (I'm turning 19 this year) and I've been to the cardiologist 3 times. The first time i went i was told i had mitral valve prolapse and that it was nothing to worry about. The second time i actually went to the er because i was experiencing shortness of breath along with a weird pulse and chest/arm pain. The doctor there said it's just anxiety and nothing else and only told me to get some food supplements. After that my symptoms would come and go and about a year and a half i went to the cardiologist i went the first time again.

 This time she told me i have mitral valve prolapse with leakage to the pulmonary valve and a distention of the aorta in the Valsalva sinus (keep in mind I'm trying to translate my doctor's note in English so I might have made some mistakes). 

Anyway after she finished the echo and the heart ultrasound she told that most of the things i experience are due to MVP and anxiety and that I'm okay but that I should also avoid things like coffee and energy drinks. I'm sure she explained things with more detail but my mind was pretty blank due to the constant anxiety I had these days lol. I still have shortness of breath and some pains in the chest and left arm that come and go along with back pains. I also get heart palpitations and a weird heart rate that is sometimes too fast and other times too slow (I went to have a blood test and an ultrasound for my thyroid a month before since my TSH was higher than normal and they came out ok and was told that I should do the tests again after 6 months).

 I just want to know if i should worry about the other notes my doctor wrote despite my mitral valve prolapse and if these symptoms i experience have anything to do with my aorta or the pulmonic valve leakage or even my high thyroid hormone. Maybe my anxiety makes my symptoms seem so serious and I'm reading into this too much..",1
"Spinning out with health anxiety Hi all,

New post, struggling big time with health anxiety, to the point that it is becoming hard to cope.

I'm 36 years, old, I have two kids, currently nursing a 1 year old. About 4-6 months ago, I started losing weight. Initially I thought nothing of it, I figured it was just being a busy mom!

But fast forward and within that time, I caught just the most random viruses, and badly. I caught a flu that immediately turned to pneumonia. I caught a viral rash from my 4 year old niece. My weight kept dropping.

At this point, I started to become understandably anxious and curious as to what was happening. I had bloodwork during my pneumonia that came back ""normal"" in her eyes. But I noticed today there was elevated platelet count and low lymphocytes. Which are commonly linked to cancer of some sort. Why did I google it?

I'm just spinning out, because I lost my dad recently to a very rare aggressive cancer. Something just doesn't add up. I'm just scared that it is something seriously wrong. I'm getting more bloodwork done to hopefully alleviate my worries now that I am healthy... it could just have been related to the pneumonia, and the weight loss to nursing, anxiety and being a busy mom. But I can't see her until next week, and it is just torturous waiting.

"Why do I feel weak and sick all the time? Freaking out for a month now. Bloodwork/uralysis results: https://imgur.com/a/divyBwV

**Please click on the images and expand them before claiming they are too blurry to read.  Thank you.**

Bilirubin was elevated, but he said it was just Gilbert's syndrome?  He is my new family doctor (Canada).  Old family doctor would have done all sorts of clinical examination (feeling abdomen for things, listening to abdomen with stethoscope, neurological testing etc.), but new doctor barely looks at me.

Daily fatigue began last March, improved somewhat in September, then worsened again in January.  I've been experiencing the following symptoms for the past month+:

* Muscle weakness - hands and legs feel shaky and uncoordinated, worried I'm going to drop glasses when I pick them up to drink, legs shake while I'm walking up and down stairs, etc.  Worsens with exertion.
* Left hand feels weaker than right, and sometimes has pins and needles sensation.
* Extreme drowsiness
* Brain fog
* Flushing in legs, chest, head, and what feels like rapid temperature fluctuations from cold to warm.
* Lower left abdominal pain and discomfort.
* Nausea and dizziness
* Feel very hungry much of the time, often shortly after eating.  Gnawing feeling of hunger.
* Seem to never gain weight despite eating 4 meals a day.
* Mild urine retention due to tight bladder neck (began 2+ years ago, diagnosed via cystoscopy in November)
* Infrequent sharp pain near anus/rectum
* Very twitchy eyelids - Initially it was only my right eyelid, but now my left eyelid twitches as well as eyebrow and upper cheek on right side.

Stool is mostly normal, but:

* Undigested bits of food in stool
* Feel like bowels aren't completely voided, but can't push the rest out.  Feeling goes away after wiping.
* Stool sometimes broken up into large chunks instead of one long stool
* Stool sometimes thin and stringy

Symptoms can be up and down, but mostly down, and seem to correlate with food on some level, although I can't figure out any meaningful pattern.  I am unsure which symptoms are connected and which are not.  The fatigue and weakness worsens with exertion, even just going for walks, making exercise difficult.  

I am a 30 year old male.  I weigh 120-125lbs, and height is 5""6.  I haven't had alcohol in over 4 years, and I've never been a heavy drinker.  I eat reasonably healthy meals, and still maintain a reasonably high appetite in spite of these symptoms.

Most distressing symptom by far is the fatigue and weakness.  Can barely keep eyes open sometimes, and it can feel like I'm tied to a ball and chain.

I had an ultrasound and liver workup, in addition to the bloodwork above, which were apparently normal.

Doctor believes I have somatic issues related to anxiety and refuses to do additional testing or refer me to any specialist.  I cannot find a new doctor, because there is an extremely long waiting list for family doctors.  While I begged him for more investigation he practically sat there laughing at me and told me to go find another doctor if I wasn't happy.

I am worried, and my quality of life is suffering.  Should I just keep going to the hospital until they agree to investigate?  What should I do?",1

I don't even know where to begin. These last few months have been absolutely unforgiving to me. I had three family members pass way in three months. I wish I was making this up. One died in October, November and early January. Also in November, I was diagnosed with early stage melanoma.

- water was fast flowing
- water was unpleasantly cold
- we have looked at the water from said river under the microscope before for unrelated reasons and could barely find any bacteria let alone amoeba 
- he has had water go up his nose as a child in a still, warmer dam (so badly that it went all the way into his throat) and it didnâ€™t affect him. 
And I know that itâ€™s extremely rare for an infection to occur, but thatâ€™s not going to stop me from worrying for the next 15 days. 
I need help. What should I do?

"Stabbing random pain in the left side of chest? Hi, I get these random stabbing pain in the left side of my chest and I'm not sure what it is... I've been to the doctor and they've ruled out any possibility of heart disease or anything else.

"Rabies Scare So I came upon a branch that had some porcupine quills embedded in it, and was stupid enough to pull a few out to get a better look. A managed to poke myself in the finger with one - it didn't go very deep (no blood) and I pulled it out right away.

Anxiety reared its head and I was suddenly worried about exposure to rabies. I did call urgent care to see what they said. They didn't know the answer right away and had to do a bit of research. The verdict that came back was ""porcupines don't carry rabies, so you should be fine."" 

I wasn't particularly confident in this assessment since porcupines can like most mammals carry and transmit rabies. I'm wondering if she was just referring to the quills.

Any way I'm still kind of freaking out - Rabies does not seem like a fun way to go.

Any reassurances? I'm sure people have been stuck with quills before without getting rabies, right?",1

"Feeling of something stuck in throat Hi all. iâ€™m very new to reddit and iâ€™ve been having the worst day. Iâ€™ve been having BPD flair ups all day and around night time i was eating dinner, stir fry with vegetables (soft ones). i had a feeling that a soft veggie peel got stuck in my throat. no matter what i did it wouldnâ€™t come out. 

Long story short (trigger warning for some..



i made myself throw up to get it out. I saw some come out but then my throat still felt like there was a lump in it. I called a nurse and she said as long as i am breathing and can swallow (which i always could) iâ€™m fine but its just feeling like there something stuck and that iâ€™ll choke in my and die. Anyone else had this feeling? could this be all in my head? I hate healthy anxiety. iâ€™ve been having panic attacks all night. just feels like thereâ€™s a lump in my throat now.

Gotta love anxiety. My hypochondria has actually been in check for the last few months because Iâ€™ve been so busy and had no time to even think about anything besides school/work. As of lately life has been incredibly stressful and I ended up getting the flu. Due to the stress it caused my period to be late which stressed me even more. Then all the sudden I got a minor ache in my groin area where *i think* the lymph nodes are located. I thought I felt it swollen but couldnâ€™t really tell as I was pushing pretty hard to feel something that Iâ€™m sure my anxiety was/is causing. Anyone have experience with swollen lymph nodes in the groin area? When theyâ€™re swollen is it clear and unquestionable that they are? Itâ€™s only the left side Iâ€™m experiencing it. I noticed if Iâ€™m occupied I donâ€™t have any kind of ache. Stupid anxiety. If I could go to the doctor I would. It would ease my fear. But unfortunately money is tight and insurance doesnâ€™t come cheap.,1
"Does chlorine definitely kill brain eating amoebas?

anxiety over leg numbness so i've had crippling anxiety/health anxiety for 2 years now. it's been such a torture in my life and i still havent gone to see a therapist (mostly financial reasons). but anyway two nights ago my left leg started feeling restless while i was lying in bed and i didn't think much of it and went to bed with no problem. i woke up forgetting about it until i remembered and the feeling came back even worse. it feels like how your limbs feel after they fall asleep and you wake them up - slightly numb and tingly and sometimes it feels kinda like how your legs burn after you exercise. this has been going on for two days and it's caused me so much panic because i automatically think its DVT. it was so bad that last night i had the worst panic attack i've ever had and i legitimately could not breathe. i took a xanax and i could breathe again and went to sleep but i've been dealing with it all day and my breathing has been hay wire today which is especially great since DVT can lead to pulmonary embolism which is shortness of breath so lol.... i'm going to the doctor tomorrow but i'm scared as hell. i'm trying to convince myself it's just a pinched nerve but it's so hard. i really hate living like this because i'm not even living at all.,1
"Excited to find this community, I have a phobia of having a heart attack and dying. I am a 31 year old woman, and I have a fear of dying from a heart attack/stroke. Every time I have a back pain, arm pain, jaw pain, nausea or uncomfortable chest feelings I get worried itâ€™s signs of a heart attack. Iâ€™ve talked to my GP about and she just told me Iâ€™m too young to worry about that, my bloodwork came back normal in October 2018. I havenâ€™t had any deaths in my immediate family who have heart attacks but one of my grandfathers had a stroke and an uncle had some heart issue when he ended up getting a pace maker.

"Diabetics Ketoacidosis and Brain Cancer Hi I'm new here. I started having very mild health anxiety when I was younger but it recently increased the last few months. In December, I went to the ER due to chest pains because I was sure I was having a heart attack even though I was terrified. I went to the doctor and they said it was just acid reflux and they sent me home with a prescription. After that, I had to follow-up with my PCP and she told me there was an abnormality in my EKG (my second one) and referred me to a cardiologist to do an echocardiogram. That same week, I was worrying about every little ache and symptom that I've read about heart attacks and kept manifesting each one. It sucked because I didn't feel like it was all in my head and I kept freaking out. Mind you, I'm a college student away from home which made everything worse. Winter break came and I went home. I didn't feel any symptoms and I wasn't worried about my health anymore. Then I came back to school last month and my friend had a stroke. She's 19 so I was surprised at how young she was to be having a stroke. This event stirred up my past anxieties about my heart and I found myself checking my heart rate often throughout my day again. I would also google every possible heart condition that I could have that I wouldn't know of. The next week, I finally got my echocardiogram done and the doctor said it was completely normal which eased my mind at little bit. That same week, I had on and off nausea which I was sure was because of how anxious I was about my health. The next few days go by and I start having tension headaches (or so I think). They were on and off as well but it just hurt to the point where I was convinced I had brain cancer. With the nausea and the headaches, I just assumed. I tried to refrain from googling the symptoms because I knew it would elevate my worries but I couldn't resist. The last few days, I've been so worried about having brain cancer because I wouldn't be able to focus and some things were hard to remember, but there is no family history of any type of cancer so I kept trying to focus on that. Now, I am currently worrying that I have Diabetic Ketoacidosis. I have no family history of diabetes and I've never been told that I should watch out for it because I am 18, normal weight, and have been healthy. But lately, I've been stress eating because of how anxious I've been and food makes me feel a little better. However, I always feel guilty right after eating and it makes me feel sick to my stomach. I just don't know how to cope with this anymore and I have a doctor's appointment next week so hopefully she can ease my mind a bit more. ",1
"what are the early symptoms of Colon cancer? (23 yrs old) (worried so much) My stomach has been having some problem for a month now, it started from a sharp sting pain in my upper middle abdomen I was checked for a possible of ulcer but turned out negative and took some ultrasound but everything is normal, I was given a Omeprazole and some antacid syrup (Aluminium hydroxide dried gel, Magnesium hydroxide) and it worked. I changed my diet, but after some time my upper left side of my abdomen begins to hurt every time I finished my food and it will go away if I release a gas or burp but moving to this week I feel suddenly feel a discomfort in my stomach ( I feel that it is filled with air) and every time I release a gas its turns ok then after a half an hour it will the discomfort will begin again. I started to search for some symptoms relating to what I'm experiencing and it kind of leads me to colon cancer though I'm not sure how to examine myself on bloody stool, and I haven't experience vomit nor nausea.  


All the test was done on a clinic, I really want to do an endoscopy to make sure so I suggested to my parents to have it checked in a hospital since we have insurance even if we live in a different country but they told me to wait and have it checked in a hospital during my vacation to our home country which is 1st week of March but I can't wait that much because of the symptoms and its giving me some worries ",1

"The cycle starts again I'm diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder but only this year have i experienced the terror of health anxiety. I went through a throat infection, which I of course thought was cancer at first, I spent hours rechecking and researching my symptoms, which started to completely take over my life. I couldn't go a second without a distraction. After the infection cleared up I was basically rid of my fears. 

Except a few days ago, I had an incredibly terrifying panic attack. I was just lying in bed and I had this faint pain in my left arm and for some reason my brain just short circuited, I jumped up, my heart started racing which led me to think I was having a heart attack. I genuinely thought I was going to die, I felt dizzy and for the first time I couldn't calm myself down. I was terrified so I went to see my mother and I just crawled into her arms like a 20 year old baby and after a few minutes everything went back to normal. And now I'm back in the cycle again. Asking myself ""what if that WASN'T a panic attack?"" and other completely illogical questions. I keep checking my heart beat, sometimes I get a spike of anxiety when I think it's too slow and same for when i believe it's too fast. 

I can't break out of this and it's taking over everything I'm so scared and so sick of living like this, does anyone have any advice on how to just make my brain chill for like just a second?",1
"Iâ€™m probably crazy I used to have horrible HA, and for whatever reason it stopped, I think I was so busy that I didnâ€™t have time to think about it.

However I just went to get a routine std checkup and I kinda mentioned in passing that Iâ€™ve been itchy (everywhere not just crotch reason.) Keep in mind Iâ€™ve had dry skin my whole life and my parents said I used to always itch when I was a kid. So in passing the nurse decided to mention the potential for SCABIES, and like a switch my mind started racing. I knew very little about scabies and now I swear I have them. The areas of my body that tend to itch are my sides and crotch region, also my arms and shoulders. 

However through my frantic googling and recent discovery of this subreddit I now think itâ€™s diabetes. Iâ€™m going to a derm on Tuesday to check for scabies even tho I now changed my mind on what it is.

Keep In mind I didnâ€™t think anything of it until this nurse said something! (She didnâ€™t even check me out either to see.)

"Intense bought of health anxiety for the first time in quite a while. I recently started on an SSRI and have been doing fairly well for the past few weeks; thoughts related to my health anxiety are present but I have been able to drive the worries away quickly. This morning was different.

I had just woken up and was laying in bed when I had a random thought; my chest feels fairly still. Normally I'm very aware of my heartbeat--due to anxiety, I think. I place my hand over my chest and realize I can't feel my heartbeat. I check my wrist and I can't feel it, either. I immediately get sent into a panic attack and jump up and start pacing furiously, hand over my chest. Now, logically, I know that if my pulse has stopped, I wouldn't be able to jump up, pace around, etc.--however, I just can't shake that sense of impending doom. When pacing, I can feel my fluttering heartbeat, but now when I'm sitting down again I can't feel it. I made the mistake of looking up why I might not be able to feel my pulse and read that a weak pulse is considered a medical emergency, so now I'm absolutely paralyzed with fear. 

Has anyone had any experience with this? Am I in real danger, or is this my over-active brain sending me into a panic over nothing at all?

"I think I am a textbook case of health anxiety. So, this all starts about 5 weeks ago. I had  strange discomfort in my side's and went to the gp when they didn't seem to get better. She ordered a full blood work and also gave me a physical examination. Bloods came back completely fine with only a slightly elevated pancreas enzyme  ( base is 100 mine was 107 ) and for some unknown reason to myself and to the doctor I convinced myself I had pancreatic cancer. Ever since the discomfort has shifted from my side's to the top of my abdomen and I obsess over every little niggle I feel. I'm constantly poking at my glands in my neck ( 5 years ago i also convinced myself I had lymphoma ) and now I'm checking every little thing my body does. They gave me  CA19.9 blood test ( used to detect tumour growth in pancreatic cancer cases ) and mine was 6.1 ( normal health person is between 1-35 ) so that should have made me feel better, it didn't. They then sent for an ultrasound which showed everything looks exactly like it should. I've literally heard from 6 doctors now mostly at the accident and emergency department, they are 99.9% I don't have pancreatic cancer  and that I probably have gastritis. So I'm getting a camera down my throat next month to test for that. 

No matter how many times they said I was ok I just keep thinking they're wrong. Something is wrong. I know my body and this doesn't feel right. I did loose some weight and my appetite went away but has since come back. So how they're throwing all these anti anxiety drugs my way: 

Diazapam - 10mg 
Propanalol - 10mg
Olanzapine - 20mg, 10mg and 5mg ( depending how bad I feel at the time )

"Scared of Pulmonary Embolism Hey guys, so the past few days or so I've been very worried about a PE.

I've kind of been on edge since then and have been experiencing various sharp pains in my chest. I went to the doctor today and they took my blood pressure and pulse which were normal, and the doc listened to my heart yesterday and it was fine. Would these seem off if I did have a PE?

About 6 months ago i had my first panic attack. This was accompanied with palpitations and i was shaking very bad. I thought i was having a heart attack. I conitnued having these panic attacks but I understood that I wasn't having one heart attack every day so I tried convincing myself it was anxiety. I went to see a doctor after a while just to make sure nothing was wrong with me and I got a referal to the hospital to have a 24h EKG taken. I did and they noticed some ""extra-beats"". My heart rate was also pretty high for short periods during these 24 hours for unexplained reasons. I assume anxiety. I recently got another referal to a cardiologist and I am going to do a lot of different tests to make sure that nothing is wrong. I got the referal to the cardiologist 2 weeks ago but I haven't recieved a letter, phone call or anything. So who knows how long it will take? I recently started having a cough. It feels like theres some wet thing stuck in my throat and I clear my throat all the time. I can sometimes feel it in my lungs as well. This accompanied with shortness of breath.

I don't know how to explain it but I'll do my best, so. Behind my chin underneath my jawline, one side is more swollen than the other when I tense my neck muscles. I first discovered it when I was prodding my neck, it's very pronounced when I tilt my head to the side. I tilted my head to the left, tensed my muscles and it felt like a huge mass under my jaw. I can feel a similar shape on the left side of my neck but it's nowhere near as big. It looks big in the mirror too.

"Worried about diagnosis I've been having some issues with my heart for the last 4 years (I'm turning 19 this year). By that I mean I'm having symptoms like heart palpitations, shortness of breath, pain in my chest / left arm / back and dizziness. 

Every time I went to my cardiologist I was told I had mitral valve prolapse and that my symptoms were caused by anxiety. I wasn't given anything about my prolapse. However, the last time I went to my cardiologist she said that along with my MVP I also have a leakage on my pulmonary valve and  a distention of the aorta in the Valsalva sinus (I'm actually trying to translate my doctor's note in English so there might be some mistakes). 

She said that I should avoid things like coffee and energy drinks and that I'm okay. She also said I must go for an exam every 2 years. She didn't really explain if my symptoms are solely from anxiety however.

That's actually why I'm writing this post to see if those other conditions beside MVP mentioned in my doctor's note are serious because I can't get it out of my mind these days.

"A story about my anxiety in the recent past, and issues i'm facing today (a little long) As my title says, I've been having an intense battle with anxiety lately. I have anxiety and depression that I was treating with Zoloft until the end of last February. I am a 21 year old male that lives in the Midwest.

**1. Last Year**

Around mid-june of last year, I had started to get some insomnia (the kind that wakes you up early), which I then blamed on the fact that my basement room is incomplete and family upstairs made a lot of noise. I also had brain fog, with all the complications that accompany it, which I had blamed on my lack of sleep. It sucked, but I decided I should wait for my mind to improve on their own. During this time, I had a slight, but long lasting, bit of anxiety about something unrelated.

During this time, I decided to drink 30ml of Zzzquil before bed in order to help me go to sleep quicker, and I would sometimes take a sip of it if I had woken up too early.

**2. A few months ago**

I lived with everything until mid-December, in which I started to have pain in my testicles and prostate, as well as my upper back and in random parts of my body. Long story short, I started to get intense anxiety about possible cancer. In order to slightly control it, I stopped drinking coffee every day and quit smoking weed once a week. Eventually, I had an ultrasound and a CT scan done, which found nothing. The symptoms associated with my lower region faded a couple of days after.

At some point along the way, I started having more symptoms, such as forgetfulness, possible confusion, numbness and tingling in my hands and feet, a feeling of dizziness or vertigo, a slight shaky feeling in my upper left arm, and what I can only describe as brain zaps. I also felt like my memory was getting a lot worse. These symptoms seemed to persist even on days when the anxiety seemed less bad. I made the mistake of googling my symptoms and good old brain cancer showed up. I pushed my doctor to give me an MRI, which later turned up nothing.

**3. A few days ago**

Over the time after I got the MRI results back, the anxiety seemed to come down from a constant 5-8 to a 2-3 (on a scale from 0-10), and while a couple of symptoms seemed to disappear over the next week and a half, I started to get new ones, such as random twitches and fasciculations in random, varying parts of my body (which I blamed on drinking coffee again) and trouble going to sleep/getting woken up in the middle of the night (which I blamed on weaning myself off of the Zzzquil I had mentioned before). When I started to go to sleep or wake up, I would also have thoughts that would make no sense. I still have these symptoms today, which is my motivation for writing this post.

I confess I still worried about things like spinal cancer and whether or not anything was actually wrong with me (aside from the anxiety), so I made the same mistake of googling again last wednesday. This time, I came across brain prion diseases, specifically vCJD, which threw me in to another state of panic and anxiety, possibly even greater than the last couple. 

**4. Today and the future**

This time, I'm worried that it might be the real deal, despite the hilariously low odds I have of actually having it. The worst part is, rationally I know I probably don't have what I'm so scared of. Luckily I had a doctor's appointment the next day after my latest googling mistake, and they set me up with a sort of behavioral counselor, as well as having me start on a different antidepressant.

I guess what I'm seeking by writing this post is reassurance that I won't be a clinically insane mess of a human due to some brain issue in 6 months. I'm constantly auditing my environment, past experiences, and my own thoughts in order to make sure I'm not hallucinating or something (like when I woke up around a week ago in the middle of the night to the smell of something burning, which could have just been my heater) 

I just feel skeptical sometimes that ALL of the symptoms I'm feeling or have felt can be due to solely anxiety, when it's never been this bad before.

The past few months have made me mentally tired, due to having to put up with the stress of daily life in addition to everything above. The insomnia and the anxiety have definitely taken a toll on me. I just hope it actually is just anxiety and nothing serious.

"Posting to maybe calm my worries... So obviously I like most likely all of us here, suffer with abit of health anxiety. I'm just wondering if i'm being a hypochondriac when I think I'm dying because I have small bumps underneath my skin on my forearm that seem to run along my vein, are they normal? does everyone else have them? maybe you yourselves could check, and if you do, I guess I'm fine... or we're all doomed... (jk but seriously) ",1
"Fell on ice and hit my head Basically like the title says, I was walking to the bus stop and I fell and hit my head pretty hard. Felt like I was gonna stay on the ground for a good bit. Didn't lose consciousness, I think, as I made it to the bus on time. I'll be home in around three hours but I'm terrified. Back then my vision was blurry and walking was a bit difficult. My balance is a bit better now but the blurry vision part still scares me. My head hurts. I took a few pain killers and wrote my mom, who told me to sleep and rest a bit but I'm terrified that maybe I need help asap and sleeping will just end with me passing out. Google, as always, never helps and I also think I might have like a small amount of internal bleeding or something. I'm struggling to stay calm. How should I go about this? Scared that this dumb concussion might be the end of me.",1
"Shortness of breath whole day Have this feeling I cant breathe and struggles in inhaling air . Also searched the internet about it and they gave me lots of nasty disease like TB,anemia and Gi bleeding so i took some iron supplements to maybe replenish my iron.

Everytime I go to school and have this feeling it makes me think im about to die any minute.",0
Health anxiety is a kind of OCD. The gold standard of treatment is ERP: expose to the anxiety without doing compulsions. Take it slowly and try to last longer and longer without giving in. Invite the discomfort and explore it.,1
"Unorotected sex with gf I never did it without a condom before but last night me and my gf of 2 months did it without a condom, she doesnt show any symptoms of an std and she says shes been with 2 other partners and used condoms with one but the other was a long term relationshi so she didnt, what is the chance that i have HIV? And what about other stds?",0
"Very small red lump underneath armpit Just a bit of a background I have always been very self conscious of my health from worrying about the smallest symptoms, to convincing myself I had ALS disease. Anyways, today after a good hour and a half workout I noticed right after a slight discomfort underneath my left armpit. I looked to check it out and there was a very small red bump that is somewhat tender to the touch. I don't know if this is just something minor like a pimple, cyst, etc. Keep in mind I stared to mysteriously break out on my face with two pimples just this morning which is quite rare. 

Or could it be a lymph node that has gone rouge. Everywhere else on my body seems normal just this one spot on my armpit. Ive been down this road before in the past, so im not freaking out about anything yet. Just wondering if anyone else in here has had something similar to this?",1
"How can I function? Bit of background. I suffered with anxiety about 4 years ago. General stress induced anxiety and then it spiraled out of control. I convinced myself I had skin cancer and made my doctor check me all over. I am fine but was told to keep an eye on my moles. Ok. No changes in 4 years. Anxiety continued and I took medication for it. Since then I have returned to normality and no longer take meds. 

I have a smear test coming up soon and I don't know how I am going to cope between the test and the results. I know it is going to trigger my health anxiety and I do not know how I will function such as getting up and going to work. 4 years ago I was in such a bad place with my health anxiety I stayed in bed for weeks and was physically sick with worry. 

How can I cope while I wait for the results?",1
"DAE get bruises that just pop up and you don't know where they came from? I noticed a big one today on the side of my elbow on my right arm, then a couple smaller ones on the front of my other arm, then a couple more on my right arm again.",0

"Anyone know much about alcohol? Ok so similar to a lot of people with anxiety I use alcohol at times to cope with anxiety. Bad I know, but medication didn't work for me. So I've been drinking a fair amount most nights but decided it's definitely time to cut down. 

I have been worried about cutting down in case of fatal withdrawal symptoms, however I haven't had a drink since Friday night and I think I feel fine? Is it possible that I could just have been enjoying alcohol rather than be addicted? I would still like to drink once a week if I could. ",1
"Just feel so overwhelmed over ultrasound. Pleas talk to me. Long story short is that i went to the DRs to get routine bloodwork done after stressing for a month, i also had her check my thyroid and hormones because after having irregular periods and feeling anxious i figured that hormones had to be it. My blood work came back fine except my testosterone was high. I started having a work up done on my ovaries and kidneys to check for tumors. My friend is a nurse at the office i was at and had the ultrasound tech check my kidneys extra well even tho it wasnâ€™t a dedicated test for them because she knew i was afraid of a adrenal tumor. The tech couldnâ€™t find anything and said if there was something there she would of seen it...but that wasnâ€™t good enough of a answer for me. 

I have to go back for a kidney bladder ultrasound and Iâ€™m spiraling out of control because i feel like THATS when theyâ€™re going to find something. I canâ€™t take it. I feel like my life is unbelievably overwhelming now and Iâ€™m too scared to go back to have the ultrasound. Please...anybody. An ultrasound tech or nurse or anyone with a similar experience. Please help me. I donâ€™t want to live like this. ",1
"Scared of heart pumping problem My mom developed cardiomyopathy - inadequate pumping due to weakening of the heart muscle, when I was 8 or 9, I'm 21 now. 
Since then she's been on medicines and her condition has improved significantly in last 12 years. 
A few years ago I started having heart palpitations which were more noticeable after I did some exercise. I was af and my parents took me to the ER but they said it's just anxiety, but as my mom has this condition, I should get it checked out. 
We went to the cardiologist the next day who ran some tests like ECG, Echo and bloodwork and everything came out normal. 
After a few months I stopped noticing the symptoms, even while exercising. 
I still get palpitations when I'm going through a phase of anxiety but rarely otherwise. 

Out of curiosity, I surfed the internet about cardiomyopathy and came to know that a person has 50% chance of inheriting the faulty gene from their affected parent and I'm really scared now. 
The articles even mentioned that in some cases the first diagnosis comes to light when a family member dies suddenly, due to cardiac arrest. 
I'm really scared now, of developing this disease now or in the near future and I don't really know what I can do about it. 

I want to mention one more thing that my mom's heart pumping has come back to normal but she still takes the medicine because a condition is a condition, so the prognosis is good in her case. ",1
"Hearing loss At what point do I talk to my doctor about not being able to hear well. I've noticed more and more struggling to hear. Last time I asked she said I just had fluid in my ear and said it would be fine. It's been 6 months since then and I've switched doctors because of her being dismissive on other things. (Rolling eyes, laughing at me etc.) 
I had the flu between then and now. And after the flu it seems like it had gotten a lot worse. And being in public with hearing issues is making my anxiety skyrocket. 

What really scares me even more is my mom had a tumor removed from her ear area that was causing hearing loss. 

What do I do? Can anyone comfort me? Is this a reason to go to the walk in or do i need to make a regular appointment? 

I would of talked to the doctor the 8th but I've had such horrible times with doctors I ended up cancelling because I was having such bad anxiety attacks. (I ordered pizza instead to calm myself, it didn't help) 

I'm not on any anxiety medication. Or anything but birth control. ",1
"High blood pressure spike Does anyone else have high blood pressure? I can never tell if my high blood pressure causes my anxiety attacks or the other way around. I guess itâ€™s not possible to know. 

I just ate fast food for the first time in a while, which seemingly cause my blood pressure to spike. My heart rate was up as if I was on a brisk walk for an hour, despite just sitting and doing deep breathing exercises. It was probably just all of the excess sodium but I just couldnâ€™t calm myself back down for anything. 

I know that digestion in general will cause a higher heart rate but when my head starts to feel hot and tight like a balloon I just have a hard time shaking the idea that something bad is about to happen.

Doing fine now, just thought Iâ€™d share in case anyone has a similar thing. â€œThis too shall passâ€

"Canker sore in back of my throat = Crohn's disease 19 y/o male, I had my first canker sore last summer near my tonsils and now I have another one. I have always had problems with my stomach, docs gastroscopied me in 2016 because I had nausea and heartburn almost 24/7. Biopsies and everything came back normal, never gotten colonoscopied though. In my mind these canker sores are a symptom of crohns disease and it must mean I have it. I just can't figure out any other explanation than that thanks to hypochondria. My stomach problems were pretty bad years ago and I thought I had colon cancer or something like that. Nowadays I feel a lot better but the thing is that if something comes up that might be a symptom of IBD/Crohns/Colon cancer I almost instantly think I have it.",0
"Daily headaches... Anyone else deal with these. Can't stand it, I feel like my fucking head it going to pop. A lot of pressure behind my left eye and top of head. Multiple tests and blood work and everything comes back normal... ",0
"Sore gland in neck for six days, feeling so down with this anxiety. Just need to vent. I've had this problem on and off for a while where it'll flare up for a few days and then go away for a while. I have no idea what triggers it. It's always the left side of my neck under my jaw. I'm assuming it's a lymph node, but I can't feel anything when I feel around in that area. But the pain is very localized to that one spot, when I press on it or turn my head it'll hurt right there. It also hurts when I swallow but not in a sore throat way, more like something is bumping against that inflammation and irritates it. 

I might go to the walk-in clinic today because I'm sick of worrying about it. I have no other symptoms besides a small headache between my eyebrows which started up about two days ago and has stayed pretty constant. It feels like a sinus headache but I don't have the other symptoms besides my typically slightly stuffy nose. 

Trying to stop obsessing over lymphoma since I know that causes painless nodes and swelling. I just hate that I'm having this for seemingly no reason. I'd feel BETTER if I had a cold because at least then I'd understand the pain came from that. 

God. I feel like I've had one thing after another for the past six months. ",1
"Mid back pain anxiety About 3 months ago I woke up with a slight pain half way up my back in my spine and just off to the right of my spine. Felt like low grade stabbing pain.
Of course I immediately thought of the c word. Since then I have noticed the pain move around and change slightly. Now it is like an ache in my thoracic spine. I also get painful tight neck pain. And I still have ongoing low back pain with sciatica since about 18 months.
My physiotherapist says he doesn't think it is anything serious and to just train harder in the gym.
I have basically resigned myself to the fact that I am dying.
But on good days I think it is a vicious circle of stress and anxiety manifestation in my back.
Anyone else get these symptoms?

"Had a heart attack scare and now my anxiety is through the roof Hi! I posted this in r/anxiety as well but i thought id post here too, hope thats ok!


So on Friday night I was rushed to the emergency department because I was having severe chest pain to the point where I couldn't even talk, I was just crying. I didn't know what it could be and it didnt even cross my mind that it could be anything to do with my heart. The pain eased up after and hour and after around 6 hours when I finally got seen by a doctor the pain was non existent. 

I explained the issue to the doctor and he told me he wasn't really worried about me seeing as I'm an otherwise healthy 20 year old but he decided to run an ECG anyway. The ECG came back showing changes in my heart rhythm that mimicked that of a heart attack and so he decided to take some blood to check. After about  2 hours he came back to me telling me that the blood test came back negative and that I hadn't had a heart attack it was probably just a panic attack and that I could go home.

Now it's a few days later and my brain wont stop going over the experience. I keep thinking something is wrong or that the doctor missed something. I keep getting chest pain and shortness of breath but my family are insisting it's anxiety after the whole experience. I dont know what to do I don't feel like myself at all and I dont want to go anywhere or do anything which is the complete opposite of how i usually am, and I've completely lost my appitite. I don't know how to shake the fact that this wasn't an actual heart attack and that I'm actually okay. I just feel completely broken and terrified. 

I'm sorry if this is a lot, or this is the wrong place I just felt like I had to write it down and maybe get some advice about what to do to make everything seem better.

TL:DR - I had a heart attack scare and although results eventually came back saying I hadn't had a heart attack I can't stop thinking somethings terribly wrong. ",1
"Weird vision Hey guys. Iâ€™ve had health anxiety for a while, but yesterday Iâ€™ve had a new experience which freaked me out. As I was getting ready for sleep, my vision suddenly changed. I was seeing colors  and felt as though i opened my eyes underwater. There were areas in my vision that were blurry, and had lines on them. I tried to close my eyes but nothing changed. I fell asleep eventually and woke up an hour later with a headache. Went back to sleep and in the morning everything was fine. However, Iâ€™m on the edge because iâ€™m scared it will happen again. Did it ever happen to you? Is it cause of concern? Thank you. Iâ€™m really freaked out right now",1
Afraid of Tetanus On my way to the bathroom I stepped on an earring standing straight up. It went about 2/3 of the way into my foot. Now i'm freaking out about tetanus. I'm nervous that I won't be able to get any sleep. ,1
"can someone tell me its really difficult to get diabetes? Hey,

I have been very anxious about possibly having diabetes for a while now. I am a bit overweight and dont exercise often. My eyesight has been declining over the past years and my family has no history of diabetes. so there is nothing to be alarmed about. However i keep thinking i have it, every little sign makes me freak out. A few days ago I found some mold in my toilet and immediately assumed it was because of the glucose in my urine or something. 

Can someone please give me some positive assuration or facts about the odds of getting diabetes due to being overweight? I think if I get told that you dont just develop diabetes for no reason, my anxiety would decline a lot. ",1
"Mucus in Stool and Anxiety Do you guys have white mucus in your stool? I'm very anxious and very often worry about my health. As the rest of you here, I ""survived"" numerous illnesses, diseases and I always worried about them without real reason.  
In the last 2+ years I have some white mucus with every stool. Sometimes barely noticeable, sometimes more. Of course I'm freaking out and think about IBD, cancer and the worst possible outcome. However I don't have any other symptoms. No abdominal pain, no blood. I even don't fit into IBS, those guys have much more troubles than me. If this is IBD or cancer I'm pretty sure I wouldn't feel well and would have more symptoms. I'm also one of those guys who afraid to be diagnosed thus I didn't visited a doctor yet.  
I had periods when I managed to convict myself that I'm fine and during that periods I have very small amounts of mucus. But a few days ago it become more noticeable, then I started to examine my poops and freaked out. Of course now I have more and more of it.  
I'm curious if this could be my anxiety only? Do you guys ever noticed mucus in your stool?",1
"SO HAPPY I FOUND YOU ALL So i have been agorohobic and having panic attacks for 6 months now. I have SEVERE health anxiety and would LOVE TIPS.

So basically I have chest pains (not in the heart area. It's like far left under breast. Sharp pain sometimes) I've had ekgs and blood tests and physicals. I cannot get over the fact something is wrong. Everyday. I'm afraid if I throw up I'm going to die. So being nauseous is my biggest fear

I go to doctors every other week to get evaluated and I always get sent away. Sometimes I break down and just start to cry and say ""I can't die now. I'm so young. Please. I can't die. Help me. I don't want to die."" over and over again becuase my toe hurts.

I'm in therapy and working on it. It's ptsd from a year ago when a client (I am a CNA) I worked with closely felt a little sick and got out of the car and threw up and died as I did cpr and he bled all over me. Then 2 weeks later my grandma died. Then 2 weeks later two friends died of random heart attacks. Healthy 20 year Old college students with no history of drugs or alcohol. One was found on her bathroom floor and they found out she had an unknown genetic heart condition. The other was eating with his girlfriend and on the way home said he felt a little sick to pull over. He threw up and died of a heart attack there.

Basically I'm terrified I have a brain tumor and my physical symptoms of my panic attacks are severe. I can't speak. My throat closes and I gag. I get cold sweats and I can't even get up to pee or drink water. Every single tiny little ache or pain in my body I fixate on for the whole day and Google 50 symptoms a day. 

I take my spo2 10 times a day. Blood pressure 8 times a day and heart rate 15-30 times a day. I've never been diagnosed with any condition ever. I've never had high BP. My hr is 62.

I'm 22 and terrified daily I will die any second and I'm working SOOOO hard to not live like this. But it feels like a million things to work on at once and my health anxiety doesn't get addressed as much. ",1
"I was doing so well... But now, Iâ€™m writing this from the ER. I woke up this evening around 3am with some sharp stabbing pains in the back of my left knee. It lasted about 5-10 min, which was just long enough for me to convince myself it was something fatal.

I used to be in the hospital every other week, but Iâ€™d been doing well over the last 3-4 months and hadnâ€™t been once, until tonight.

"Anxiety or something serious? (MS worries) Hi, Iâ€™m here, again..

About one year ago I posted here about my MS worries.

So here is my short story (longer in previous post):

October 2017
- nausea, dizziness, 14 days headache around right temple and behind eye, fatique, weak legs, twitching all around my body (eyelids, around mouth the most, tinnitus, burning sensations (especially in right foot) etc..
Then I started googling which was the dumbest idea in my whole life..
November 2017
- sensation lost around left knee
- MRI of brain/spine (1,5T machine) (few very small and absolutely non specified white spots)
- SSEP, EEM, EEG, EYE exam, bloodworks for EVERYTHING (lyme, hiv, syphilis, ...) and EVERYTHING is okay..

Then the problems slowly went away, but sometimes I still have dizziness, nausea, eyepain, headaches, tinnitus for few seconds, burning and tingling sensations, weak legs..everything is on/off

January 2019
- follow up MRI of brain/spine (3T machine) and everything is same as previous MRI

More than 10 doctors told me its nothing serious (no MS!!)  and it can be psychosomatic..
BUT
Im still conviced it could be something serious.

What do u think?
Somebody with same problems?

Thanks! M.",1
Worried about glaucoma I have been worried about this on and off for about 8 months now. I have always had bad vision and it keeps getting worse. Iâ€™ve had eye exams every year and nothing about glaucoma was ever mentioned except for once when I was maybe 14 and they said they wanted to keep an eye on it but by the next appointment my eye was  normal. The vision I my right eye has been getting worse and has just recently turned a bit red. I am 19 years old and studying to be a nurse but I cannot do that if Iâ€™m blind. Any thoughts about this? ,1
"Have sore lymphnodes form infection in arm. Worried about sepsis I had a small pimple on the inside of my right arm come up last Thursday. The area started hurting and the lymphnodes on my armpit became tender. I went to a walk in clinic Monday and they drained the pimple and sent me out. I went back in today and they looked over the area and gave me antibiotics due to the lymphnodes still being tender and the pain radiating into my chest.

I picked up the prescription and got home and realized I have the wrong prescription. So now my worry is that it will get a lot worse through the night and Iâ€™ll develop sepsis.",1
"Insomnia driving me crazy I always had sleep issues but it has been getting worse since December. I was on trazodone 100mg for a year, all of the sudden it stopped working. Tried increasing my dose, didn't help. I was put on ambien, made me do weird stuff. Next, I tried Lunesta but it didn't work. Melatonin doesn't work, zzzquil/benadryl doesn't work. 

It takes me forever to fall asleep and I wake up 2 hours later,  around the same time. Takes me a bit to fall back to sleep, just to wake up again. Last night I woke up around the same time but couldn't fall back to sleep. I'm worried something serious is causing my worsening insomnia, I read cancer causes insomnia and so can other diseases.

Now I'm scared I have some type of cancer or other serious disease. Makes me think this is why nothing seems to help me and why my trazodone stopped working. This is only going to make my insomnia worse..",1
"On/off throbbing pain same place on head for almost 3 weeks Let me preface by saying, this has been the most stressful time of my life (check my post history for an idea.)

2 1/2 weeks ago, I got a dull throbbing pain on the back right of my head, directly behind my right eye. It comes and goes throughout the day, always in the same general area. I donâ€™t believe the pain has increased, but because I am hyper aware of it, Iâ€™m stressing *badly*.

My eyes seem to be sore as well, maybe a bit of light sensitivity. Donâ€™t have insurance to go to a gp....

"Going out on a limb here - anyone else have benign brain calcification? I used to work at a cancer hospital and had severe health anxiety about brain tumors. I went to several doctors, all of which said I was healthy. I finally worked up the courage to go to a neurologist and upon seeing how anxious I was, she gave me a brain MRI. 

It turns out that I had an incidental finding which was â€œbenign brain calcificationâ€. She said it is unremarkable and the rest was deemed â€œnormalâ€. 

I had another CT a year later, and the size was unchanged. So that could indicate Iâ€™ve just had it my whole life and means nothing, and they pushed the next CT to 5 years away (which would be next year or the year after). They did say that if Iâ€™m having symptoms such as a headache (they gave no other symptoms), that we can schedule it sooner. 

Iâ€™m just terrified that itâ€™s multiplying in my brain right now or something. I have terrible health anxiety and get horrible symptoms, especially with vision. Iâ€™m just nervous that itâ€™s the calcification causing this and not my anxiety. 

Has anyone else had experience with this? Or any doctors that can give me some reassurance? I know I should just make an appointment with the neurologist, but she already thinks Iâ€™m crazy and told me to see a psychologist about my anxiety (which I do) lol. 

Thanks on advance! ",1
"Stomach worries I've always suspected I had IBS but my symptoms wouldn't flare up enough for me to really consider it. Last week I was getting pregnancy scares because my stomach felt like it was moving. I quickly took a test and it was negative. 
Then a couple days after I got a sore throat and stomach ache and sinus congestion. This has set me off big time, worst I have had it since 2015. My stomach aches after eating anything and I'm not popping that much. My tummy feels like I've done a hundred sit ups and I don't know whether it's my anxiety manifesting into physical feelings or my stomach is telling me something serious is up. 
This is really starting to get to me and I'm so petrified of the the doctors, the thought that I should just go and get some reassurance is scaring me too. I comfort ate last night and that set my stomach off obviously. Erghh",1
"Worried I could have contracted HIV at work I am a nurse who works in a doctor's office where we perform minor outpatient procedures for skin conditions. I was injecting a patient with local anesthetic (lidocaine) on the back. While injecting the lidocaine, all of the sudden a stream of liquid started squirting out of the cyst I was injecting, but only while I was injecting the anesthetic. It was clear liquid. It happened to squirt right on my mouth and lips. I was not wearing a mask at this point. I immediately wiped the area, and then went and told the physician who I work with, as I didn't know if it was just anesthetic that has come out, or was whatever the cyst was consisting of. He stated that he would be able to tell as soon as he got in there to remove it. He injected more anesthetic and he same stream of liquid came out of the same location. He assumed it was likely lidocaine (the medicine) coming out of a pore. 

I was surprisingly fine right after it happened, but now I am so concerned about any exposure to blood borne pathogens (hep c and hiv, as I am vaccinated against hep b). I am not sure if I was exposed to blood, as it was only whatever liquid it was that splashed onto my mouth. I am concerned because my lips were dry and slightly cracked, and I had a small (very small) cut as well. Being a medical professional myself, I understand how those diseases are spread, and I don't want to be unreasonable in my worry. There is just a part of me that wonders if there was blood mixed in with the fluid, as I was injecting anesthetic with a needle and there was some small amount of blood on his skin from previous pokes with the needle, and that the cracks/cut on my lips could have been exposed to any virus. The physician stated he would be glad to have the patient and myself tested if I am concerned, but he does not seem too concerned himself. I know there is also no difference in testing the patient at this point or waiting to get tested myself in a few weeks, as the outcome would be the same. I am simply wanting to hear if anyone has any thoughts and wanted to vent. 

As far as I know, the patient was healthy and not HIV or hep c +, though there is no way to be sure without a test. This is my first real exposure to any ""body fluids"" in my career, so I am very curious what others think or to get any advice on how to calm my mind. 

I am already planning to get myself tested in a few weeks once the typical ""window period"" of infection has passed. I know having the patient tested would be the easiest way for me to get quick results (and relief from anxiety) but I do not want to offend the patient, either. I am getting sick with worry! 

Thank you in advance to anyone who responds. I appreciate you listening.

"3 weeks of crazy medical symptoms and scared out of my mind Not sure where to even start. 

Around Christmas time I was drinking pretty heavily and abusing phenibut pretty bad. Once I returned back to work I slowly tapered everything down, but still had lingering vertigo and dizziness. I went to the occupational nurse and explained this to her so she sent me to the ER after seeing my blood pressure through the roof. 

EKG, chest x-ray and blood work all came back okay. Blood pressure a little on the high side but no big deal. 

A few days goes by and I'm noticing my eye is driving me nuts, like it's super dry and irritated. I keep checking it and it looks fine. Check it again and I notice my eyebrow is hanging lower than normal so I panic because I'm thinking stroke and go to the ER. Get halfway there and get this rush of a weird taste in my mouth and I suddenly feel super weak and out of it. My head feels like it's expanding and I can't string a sentence together and my neck and shoulder muscles feel like they're all as tense as they possibly can be. Ambulance takes me to the ER, get EKG, chest x-ray and blood work and they give me a xanax and send me home saying it was a panic attack. 

Next time I'm in the ER it's the same thing. I start noticing my neck muscles are super tense and my heart is pounding and I try to keep calm for as long as possible, but it doesn't go away so I go to the ER again. CT scan, blood work and a small dose of ativan and I'm fine. 

Third time I convince myself sudden proptosis. PANIC. Go to the ER again, same symptoms. My head feels like it's rushing with fluid, neck muscles are insanely tense and I'm freaking out. Checks my eye pressure and gives a quick exam and I'm fine. 

Go see my regular doc and I keep explaining to him it's not anxiety. Never had attacks like these in my life. Did the usual neurological tests when I explained fear of a stroke and it was all fine. He asked me to smile. Asked me to really smile. Explained to him my left arm had been feeling a little weaker than normal and my armpit felt almost numb or inflamed. So he ordered an MRI because he said it felt colder than the other. 

Came home and checked my smile in the mirror and noticed the right side of my face is pretty much paralyzed. I can barely smile, but I can close my eye. My eyebrow hangs lower than the left and my cheek sags a little. I called the ER doc and she said it's probably Bell's Palsy. Probably a ~3 week timeframe. 

So I'm terrified I have a tumor or MS or something. I did have a CT scan that came back clean. The only symptom I still have is the drooping on my face. I keep thinking my left arm feels weak, but I'm not even really sure. It's like the more I focus on it the worst it gets, but otherwise I don't really notice it. Maybe it feels mildly colder. 

Right now my balance is fine. I find my self falling asleep for a few seconds at a time randomly when I'm at my desk, but I sleep like shit because of anxiety. When I'm sitting down I get these weird feelings like someone's walking up the stairs, like you can feel it in your butt from the vibrations, but nothing's actually happening. My vision has been blurry for the past two years, but my eye doctor said it's nothing to be concerned about. 

I don't even know. My doctor is out until the beginning of March and all I want are my MRI results so I know what's going on. Are these panic attacks, is this just bell's palsy brought on my all of the stress of the past three weeks?

I'm fucking terrified. Sorry for the rant. ",1
"Should I see a neurologist? Worried about Brain Tumor? Hey everyone,

I've been a bit worried about having a brain tumor in the past few days. Had some small headaches two weeks ago, usually when I had shitty sleep. Had some more bad headaches this past weekend, though I had shitty sleep. They came in the morning and then in the evening. Took some Ibuprofen and it went away, but kinda came in a dull ache when I was starting at the computer screen about two hours later.

Ever since Monday, I have not had the headaches except sometimes in the morning when it is a dull kind of feeling, not really a pain. I dont wake up with them but then I start thinking about the headache and felt stressed and then it came on. Goes away after two hours and it hasnt come up again the past few days. I had one today and I took a tynelol and the pain went away after an hour. Also haven't had nausea, unless I had pizza pops or greasy food. No Seizures, though yesterday as I was sleeping, my right leg moved a bit but that was it. I dont know if thats a seizure.

Not any cognitive problems. My speech and personality are fine but I have been on edge as I have been thinking and reading about Brain Tumors. Recently, with my memory, I am able to recall stuff fine but when I remind myself to do something after, I kept repeating to myself what I have to do because I read about someone who was worried he had a brain tumor and he kept forgetting stuff after 20 seconds. After this, I am worried I might be forgetting things. I did a memory recall test where I got over 84% in recalling images. Im not forgetting questions or anything of the sort, but I have been on edge recently. I am 21. 

I do have a cold, and had some pressure in my ears and nose that have gone away, but I am going to see the doctor. Do you think I should see a neurologist?  What I am worried about is the headaches in the morning? They were bad this weekend, but got better and have not been painful.

Generally, I found the headaches occured when I had bad sleep. I've been sleeping quite late, like at 2:30-2:50 and waking up at 9 or 10. I do move a lot when I sleep so I probably sleep past that.

"I choked on a grape and now I'm worried that it got into my lungs, does this sound possible? As stupid as this sounds, my anxiety is telling me that since I was eating a grape and laughed and coughed a bit, I inhaled the juice and my lungs are going to react. Should I worry?  

The long version is: I laughed while eating a grape and it caused me to cough, it was more coughing than I'm used to and it burned a bit, so I was worried that I didn't cough it out well enough. I'm feeling a little tired now (6hrs later) and short of breath and my mucus is that sickly yellow. I felt immediate pain an hour after it happened but I don't feel it anymore, but most of these might be health anxiety. I haven't coughed since it happened, which should tell me that nothing is wrong but I'm worried nonetheless. I spend most of my time worrying about this sort of thing and I realise it's bordering impossible to have it happen but I can't stop worrying. ",1
"Sternum Popping and Pain I'm a 31/M. For the past 2-3 weeks my sternum has been audibly popping. Like my wife heard it the other night when we were eating dinner.

I went to the Dr yesterday and got an x-ray and and ECG which she said looked slightly abnormal compared to an ECG I had in 2014. She is sending me to a cardiologist. I don't know my x-ray results yet. My appointment with the cardiologist is Feb 25th. Seems so far away, and I keep thinking, what if I have a heart attack between now and then?

There was a skinny feral cat in my yard this evening. I have not seen him before. It was clear he was neutered a while ago. I happened to have just bought canned cat food and was bringing it inside when I saw him licking/biting a paper plate I had left out earlier that day to feed another feral cat. I opened a can of cat food and dumped it out. The offending cat was ravenous and ate a whole can in less than one minute. I fed him another can and he scarfed about half of it. Then he was happy and let me pet him. Afterward, he started cleaning himself. I began walking through my yard and he started to follow me. Then out of no where, he scratched and bit my leg through my work pants. It wasnâ€™t super hard but when I came inside, I see it slightly broke my skin. I washed it with soap and water but now Iâ€™m worried about rabies exposure. Iâ€™ve attached a picture of the scratch/bite. Any input would be greatly appreciated as I donâ€™t know Iâ€™m being anxious over nothing or if there is a real health  threat here. ",1
"I got innocently bit by a feral kitten trapped in my house, now I'm dying of course. Two feral kittens were eating food my family put out for them and our cat scared them, so they ran inside the house. In the process of trying to literally herd cats, one of them bit my knuckle while I tried fishing him out of the corner. I washed it with alcohol and soap for 10 minutes.

After doing some Googling (!!!) I went to the ER two days later. I must have rabies!

After explaining the situation, the nurses and doctor were very reassuring that I probably didn't need a rabies vaccine. They said it was ultimately up to me, but she said ""in my professional opinion, I wouldn't get it."" As it was expensive and insurance might not cover it.

So I got a tetanus shot and antibiotics instead.

Tetanus shot made me feel like trash and now I've had a the subtlest, mildest of headaches for three days. It's so light I'm not even certain I have one half the time. I'm hyper aware of every muscle twitch I have. When my hands get cold I panic thinking they're going numb. I check to make sure I can still swallow.

Any day now the headache will get intense and I'll wake up to my hand being completely numb. Then I'll go back to the ER and they'll tell me there's nothing they can do because I'm dead meat. 

It happened on the 9th and all of the feral cats appear fine still. Mom and dad cat and three kittens. None rabid or dying.

But I'm still dying. And constantly on alert about my body. Does my head hurt or am I making it hurt by thinking about it so damn much?

To make it worse, I got taken off my Ativan ages ago because I switched doctors and the new one refuses to prescribe anything remotely addictive.

The weekend prior to that I went to an event and had purchased a new bra, turns out it was a wee bit ill fitting and I was uncomfortable in it but didnâ€™t think much of it.

Turns out ill fitting bras can mimic heart attack pains and my shoulders and arms hurt because the straps were too tight.

"actual problems mixed with anxiety I have one legitimate issue that i will get an appointment for on monday (sadly, the weekend is inbetween).  
My BPM, which usually is around 55-65, got higher and flip flops around a lot (it is between 80 and 100 now when i am sitting or lying down) and my bloodpressure similarly got a tad higher (not to worrying heights, it is below 140) and, what is worrying me, flip flops around a lot when i take several measurements (like going from 100 to 130 and back several times when i do not move and measure 10 times over the course of some minutes, even when i am sitting still and relaxed).

This is an issue i legitimately think might have to do with my thyroids (no cancer fears about the thyroids, i think it might just be hyperactive and that makes sense because i am celiac and celiacs often have other autoimmune diseases, most commonly thyroid stuff).

Now to what actually makes me scared and is probably nothing:

Today, after a long time of it not happening (happened a lot before my celiac diagnosis), my whole body vibrated with my pulse (i could feel it everywhere, most importantly neck), my pulse was actually off (too high, above 100 even when sitting, sometimes going as far as near 120) and i felt pressure in my gutts and chest. The pressure was so bad that, depending on how i moved, it felt like organs press on organs and i felt sick.

My neck was not only vibrating with my pulse, it also got very tensed (not some kind of stiffness that made it unable to move, but i felt like someone grabbed me just at the start of the back of my head and pressed his finger into it, shutting down the blood flow except for the very strong pulsations).

I had these symptoms before (more or less) as i said, and I assume that it is Roemheld syndrome (a benign, but very scary kind of thing) because i know that my heart is fine. It got very thoroughly checked back then and it was fine in the months before, i could do sports, i am not feeling weak, i am not having syncopes).

Roemheld syndrome means that you got so much pressure in your gutts due to air and food that it presses against your heart, chest and lungs so you experience very scary sensations, similar to angina pectoris, but it is not actually dangerous. Your heart rate is increased, your chest feels tight, you might have shortness of breath, but you are going to be fine once the pressure is gone. But that can take a long time and in that time you think you will die and you need to go to the ER.

I had that today, the first time in almost a year and i was kinda broken that it came back. I thought i beat it, and then suddenly here i am, thinking i got a lung emboli, or my veins are shut down, or there is a tumor pressing on my heart or veins. Or i got a brain aneurysm because i also felt pulsations in my head and heard noises in my air (i dont think these are noises it usually makes when you got very high bp, since my bp is not actually that high and it was only one air AND i got a head MRT the year before and it was fine).  


Now, i am very sure that roemheld is what caused this, because yesterday i drank a lot of booze and cola while eating and i had a bit of pressure before that to begin with, but the reason that i am still like 'ya, gonna die' is that i lost so much weight compared to last time.  
I lost more than 10 kilo so there should be far more space for my innards. I am not overweight anymore.

So, what my anxiety brain thinks is this: Back then, a tumor right behind my sternum, pressing on my heart. Ofc the pressure got better when i lost weight and stuff, but now it grew enough to make up for it and it presses again against my heart and no doctor will check for that (obviously the tumor is not visible via sono but NEEDS MRT or CT) and at some point it will just destroy my heart and I will die. Or my neck or bones presses on important veins and i will also die because the vein will burst (even tho i had an mrt of the neck (for legit reasons) just 2 months ago and while my neck had issues, noone said anything about veins).

&amp;#x200B;

I am fine now because i drank a lot of herbal tea that helps with roemheld, but i am still here thinking about tumors and also thyroid cancer.

As a bonus point, i think about it even being my own fault because i might have ingested gluten accidently (i probably didnt, but i live, for some time, with a non celiac so there is some chance there was contamination of my food, but he is careful and i am too, so it aint probable) and the gluten made the belly angry.

I really hope this was a one time thing and i am not falling back into anxiety due to roemheld, i will be extra careful about food in the next days.  


I will not eat today until the belly died down (and sadly my eating choice are limited due to celiac in any case, not a lot of good 'get healthy' food, at least not in my flat) and drink very much of the herbal tea.

&amp;#x200B;

When i feel better, i will do some sit ups and push ops to try to straighten out my belly and i will massage my neck as much as i can.

So far i am at least not predialing the medics anymore.

"Brain tumor anxiety Hey everyone, I'm new to this subreddit. I feel like recently I've been suffering from health anxiety. It suddenly came up out of nowhere. First I was convinced something was wrong with my heart, I started having lots of different symptoms and was truly convinced something was wrong. Got it all checked, and it turned out fine. Afterwards I still felt kinda sick, so I got a blood test done which came back clear. This was about 3 weeks ago. 

A bit later I started having these headaches, and my vision suddenly got worse (at least I got the impression). Now I don't know if this is purely because I started focusing on it, or that it actually is something bad. Anyway, I decided to go back to the doctor since I work in IT, and dealing with the vision thing and headaches was getting pretty hard.

&amp;#x200B;

He checked me, asked lots of different things but he didn't seem quite sure about what it was. He sent me to an eye doctor, got my eyes checked there, and it turned out I need resting glasses for screen work ETC. (My eyes have been bad my entire life, had glasses since I was 3). I've also been having this visual snow, again I think I've had this for a long time, but it's like my mind suddenly seems to notice and freak out about it, same with things like my tinnitus which I've also had for years.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm still just scared I may have a brain tumor, because of the bad vision and headaches. But, if I had a brain tumor, they would have seen it in the blood test from a few weeks back, right? Or no? The doctor or eye doctor would have rang the alarm bell if something was seriously wrong, right?

From there, my panic takes over and my heart begins to race, my stomach hurts and I feel nauseous, I get a tension headache, and I feel all wound up and ready to flee. My upper neck and shoulder muscles have been incredibly tight lately, so rationally I'm sure this spinal feeling is just a result of muscle tension and anxiety, as well as the crappy dorm mattress and my poor posture.

"Fears of ALS or other Motor Neuron Disease. Please help! M. 27 years. Type Two Diabetic - diet and medication controlled. History of chronic back pain, around T6-T7 vertebrae, unilateral up until a few months ago, now bilateral.

For a few weeks I've had a light flickering that alternates in each eye. This is accompanied with occasional twitching, particularly in my right tricep, forearm and occasionally my hand. These occur any where between once and three to four times a day, and while strong are often brief.

I am pretty sure that the symptoms started after a pulled muscle in the right side of my neck. I had some stiffness for a few hours one morning, before I turned my head suddenly, causing a shooting pain up that side of my neck and within a short time, a massive headache, (lasting about a day) followed by an inability to move my head properly for a few days.

Smaller twitches occur up and down my legs, though I feel that may have to do with acute sensitivity due to how much anxiety this is causing me. And I have had a lot of lower back, hip and left leg pain that has come and gone for the last five or so years.

Other symptoms that occur include pain and weakness in my pinky, shoulder and inner forearm that come and go. These symptoms are exacerbated when I am seated, at work and are particularly intense when I am at work, using a mouse, keyboard, or when my arm is crooked at an awkward angle for too long, such as using my phone.

Logic tells me that all of this is caused by a combination environmental factors and anxiety, given that about 8 months ago, I made the transition from a standing job (various retail positions for about 8 years), to a desk job, and I've NEVER had great posture. 

My physio is confident that all of this is caused by compression of the Cervical spine, where he says there is obvious stiffness between the joints in some parts, particularly at the base of the skull. He also says the spindle especially likes to compensate, so pain in one area untreated can eventually lead to difficulties along the whole spine, and that after ten years of untreated pain, he isnt surprised by my symptoms. He and my GP suggest seeing a neurologist, but only if my symptoms persist. 

Sorry for the long post. This has really allowed me to catalogue and rationalise my thoughts. In all honesty, I am feeling as though this may be anxiety. An abnormal ultrasound showed possible cancer of the testicle this time last year, and I've been spiraling ever since... I also knew it was a bad idea to read Stephen Hawkings posthumous novel at a time I wa already so anxious, but alas, I did, and have suddenly started experiencing the twitching.

I do get acid reflux and I have bad seasonal allergies, but neither of those things caused my cough before a year or so ago.

"I am going to share with you something that has always cheered me up and calmed me down whenever I get really anxious over my health So this sub only seems to really have posts from users describing their symptoms and trying to get diagnosed on Reddit, now if that helps you with your anxiety that's cool, however it can be counter intuitive as the whole googling and obsessing over symptoms is the actual problem we all came here to rid ourselves in the first place. So I honestly do believe we should move more away from ""I have x,y,z symptoms am I going to die?"" to ""How can I find peace of mind and stop googling"" 


One thing I do to get peace of mind is watch this episode of [Hey Arnold](https://www.wco.tv/hey-arnold-season-2-episode-5-monkey-business-2) which is my all time favourite show (it's only the first episode in the video provided called 'monkey business' btw), I won't ruin it for you all, but it's really funny and will hit home for all of us, it highlights how silly we can be sometimes when we think we have a really bad illness and start obsessing over symptoms. Hopefully it can help you all in your journey in controlling your hypochondria like it has done for me.

"Chest/Back pain Hi guys
over the last week and a half Iâ€™ve been having constant pains in my chest and back. The pain moves around constantly, sometimes its only one side, then its only my spine.

"Please help; Orthorexia, health anxiety, veganism and internet quacks Hi there, 

&amp;#x200B;

I experience health anxiety and orthorexia, I have a really unhealthy relationship with food and my health anxiety revolves extremely around food. However, I have spent so much money on tests and seeing doctos and am at my wits end. Every health test I have had through a legitimate NHS doctor, gastroenterologist and specialist I have been told I have nothing to stress about. I had a blood test for pernicious anemia, a full blood count test for everything, a stool test through the gastroenterologist. My worry now is that I have SIBO or some weird gut disease. I am also vegan. However, I am worried that I am being misled by internet quacks who want to sell fake or bullshit health tests, out of desperation a few weeks ago i bought and took an organic acids test and it cost Â£256, and the online nutrition coach who sells the test recommends I take a SIBO test so i can know if I have it, but im concerned ill just be given a false positive which will further amp up my health anxiety and orthorexia. I even spent Â£300 on a mercury tri-test because I was worried I had mercury poisoning from fillings - Which I now recognise as untrue and a very common case of health quackery. I spent Â£200 on 'viome' where you send a stool sample and its completely bogus. I dont know what to do, i'm obsessed with the idea that my anxiety is linked to my gut health even though I dont have any of the genuine symptoms of SIBO. I'm just sick of being obsesseed with my health and the food I eat. it had got to the point where I lost a stone and weighed 49-51kg as a 21 year old male at 5""6.

"Been Feeling Feverish ++ Hello! For a while now, I've been feeling feverish, but whenever I go get my temperature checked, it always comes out as normal. Also, I've been having these cramps in my legs, arms and feet. They're not exactly in extreme pain, I guess, but I feel that there is something terribly wrong. Is there something wrong? Is it just my anxiety acting up again?

++ I'm also worried about having a brain tumor, but then again, the only proof I have is having some sort of brain fog + I've been stumbling with my words and have trouble retrieving them. It might be my anxiety... Can't stop thinking about this.

"Swollen lymph node in neck and groin for months Hello!

So Iâ€™ve always had lymph nodes that I can feel easily. The two underneath my jaw swelled up when I was about 12 and remain enlarged now Iâ€™m 21. About a year ago I had felt a squishy node in my neck (itâ€™s smaller than a grape) and also one of the same size in my groin region. They are moveable. O do not recall any reasons for them swelling up.

I went to the DR in September who didnâ€™t seem concerned about them, but told me to go back if they didnâ€™t disappear in a few weeks. Of course theyâ€™re still here,and I chose not to go back to the DR as I had no other symptoms and thought the stress of having scans etc would do more harm than good.

Iâ€™ve felt absolutely fine since the , the nodes havenâ€™t increased in size. But I read a story about how lymph nodes should always go down, and now Iâ€™m scared I have lymphoma.This is giving me massive anxiety and symptoms :( 

I plan to ask the Dr tomorrow, but I think I just want some reassurance until then as Iâ€™m driving myself crazy! ",1

"Anyone ever have to wear a holter monitor? Thank god this thing isn't checking blood pressure or I would screwed... 

I've been having an increased awareness of my heart beat lately. Not necessarily palpitations, just like, I'm constantly aware of the blood closing through my body. Occasionally I feel a flutter in my throat. I asked my doctor about it and he asked if I wanted a 48-hour holter monitor just to be sure. Of course I said yes.

The nurse who put the monitor on me said a lot of very terrifying things about how rare it is for her to see a monitor come back with normal results. She was a real Debbie Downer and it did not help my anxiety about this whole thing. 

So I figured I would ask y'all - have you ever had a holter monitor that came back with good results?

"Has anyone been cured of health anxiety? Iâ€™m getting to the point of where Iâ€™m just fed up with this. I know my anxiety is irrational yet I still canâ€™t help but worry myself into a panic attack everytime I have the mildest of symptoms. Most of my health anxiety revolves around chest pains I get. Iâ€™ve seen countless doctors and specialists and theyâ€™re convinced itâ€™s either musculoskeletal or anxiety related. Yet everytime I feel that mild ache in my chest that most people would probably ignore I feel convinced that this time its it. This time its really a heart attack or some other life threatening event. Iâ€™ve even bought myself a portable ekg monitor which I use almost every time I have my chest pain symptoms to calm myself down. Has anyone been cured of this? This health anxiety is relatively new for me.

"Anyone else get really bad feelings of impending doom without being scared of a specific illness? My health anxiety is weird in that I don't really fear any 'specific' illness. Instead I worry about dying of an unknown/undiagnosed condition. I worry specifically that my consciousness is about to end, that I'm beginning the process of passing out and I'm never going to wake up.

I primarily get intense feelings of impending doom which leave me paralysed with fear, often unable to do anything but lie down in bed and close my eyes. In the past I used to go to the hospital a lot and beg the doctors not to let me die, but now I at least have the courage to just freak out at home.

The impending feelings of doom are so intense they leave me shaking and feeling cold. Sometimes while huddled in bed in the midst of a panic attack I even involuntarily shake and yell out things to myself like ""Please I don't want to die"". Like the fear of death is so strong I actually blurt things out reflexively without being able to control it.

This is happening to me basically every day now and leading me to spend increasing amounts of time just lying down at home. When I try and socialise I'm often distracted from the conversation by thoughts I'm about to die. I spend about 80% of my life fixated on these horrible thoughts aboht dying and about 10-20% of my life experiencing this intense feeling of doom.

I need help. I don't want to live like this any more.

I didnâ€™t think  much of it at the time but whenever Iâ€™m in a high stress situation, having an anxiety attack, or when Iâ€™m trying to fall asleep the thought comes into my head and it scares me so much. I feel like Iâ€™m trapped in my brain and itâ€™s like a bomb can go off any second and I would just die.

"Doubling up on Ibuprofen and Aspirin/Acetaminophen? Well, I should start this by saying I have a history of headaches near the front and sides of my head(I'm not sure what exactly caused it and I'm considering seeing a doctor about it but that's not the point of this post), and yesterday I had one of these horrible headaches. I took 600mg of Ibuprofen for it and about 12 hours later 500 mg or Acetaminophen and Aspirin(Also 130 mg of Caffeine but I doubt that'd have an effect).

&amp;#x200B;

Upon waking up today I had the same headache as yesterday and I took my medicine I take every morning which is too much to list but they don't interfere with either, but I also took the 500 mg or Acetaminophen and Aspirin. About 10 minutes later the headache was still horrible(It was so bad that I forgot I took the medicine) and I took 600mg of Ibuprofen.

&amp;#x200B;

While I generally try not to double up(or triple up because Acetaminophen and Aspirin in one pill??) and generally limit myself to 400mg of Ibuprofen every 6 hours at least with some cases like yesterday and today where my headaches are generally bad, I will go up to 600 mg and possibly even 800 mg if the original 600 mg of Ibuprofen didn't work after an hour. I really try to avoid this because I've had some stomach issues when I take too much that will go away after taking a normal dose for a while. Even when just taking 200 mg of Ibuprofen I try not to take Aspirin at the same time but I forgot about it because that's just how much pain I was in.

&amp;#x200B;

I most likely have a migraine and combined with sinuses and bad weather outside it can cause these headaches. Luckily the medicine has helped quite a bit but I know they can have side effects and shouldn't be taken together very often(especially in the doses I took them)

&amp;#x200B;

The point of this post is I want to make sure I'm not in immediate danger of anything for taking 500mg of Acetaminophen and Aspirin with 600 mg of Ibuprofen at once(Not asking for the future, I don't plan on taking that much I just want to make sure I'm safe) 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR:

 I forgot I took 500 mg of Acetaminophen and Aspirin in 2 pills(same pain killer) because of my headache and just waking up and then took 600 mg of Ibuprofen about 10 minutes later and I just want to make sure I'm not at risk for doing this once.

Don't plan on doubling up like this in the future and it was a mistake of me being in so much pain combined with being tired from just waking up.",0

While browsing one day, I saw someone say that they wait to go to the doctor until they've been having symptoms for 2 weeks. I started thinking about that, and it has helped me sooo much to internalize it.

Whenever I have a weird symptom (most days), I tell myself this: ""That's fine. Have something weird happen. I will go to the doctor in **two weeks** if it hasn't gotten any better. I will freak out then, but I'm not going to worry about it until it's time to book the appointment."" And believe it or not, symptoms almost always disappear within a day or two.....

"Irrational Fear of Developing Food Allergies Has anyone ever felt that before? Iâ€™ve seen only one post online about it.

Hereâ€™s the thing. When I first started having big anxiety attacks, I read one book and watched a series where a character dies from food (peanuts) allergy.

"Shin splints persisting for more than a month, dont know if i should wait...  

Hey people.

Back in december 8th, i had some ankle pain which came after sitting or sleeping, and went away after walking for a bit. This continued until around new years eve and went away. During that, i have been trying to get a faster 5k time, running 2 times a week at a moderate pace. Keeping at it, at january 16th, i ran significantly faster because i increased my cadence from 165 to 180, so i took 4 minues off my 5k.

The day after, my shin started hurting, a dull ache on the upper 2/3 just outside my shinbone. The pain was very diffuse, and I still have trouble finding out if it is my bone or muscle hurting. However this pain came only when i stood for a long time, and at night. Running on it didnt really change the pain, however I was limping a little bit (a friend pointed it out, he didnt know about it).

I stopped running on the 22nd january, hoping it would get better, However, the pain persisted. At the 31st of january, I called my doctor and asked for an appointment, she game me one at february 26th, which i think is a long time to wait with this ache, however since it didnt really hurt THAT bad, so i guess i could wait (pain is 3-4 out of 10).

On february 2nd, i went skiing, and the pain subsided a littlebit, however it has been acompanied with a sharper, more localized pain an inch below my tibial tuberosity, and one to the left of it(PIC: [https://imgur.com/jNpPV1r](https://imgur.com/jNpPV1r)) . I dont know if this is because I have fallen a couple of times (I had many more bruises, but they disapeared 4-5 days after coming home). I came home on the 10th of february, and My pain still persists, i have tried the RICE method, and stretching, nothing works.

At the point im typing this, I havent run for a long time, and its been 10 days since ive been skiing. The pain has increased this week, and today it is on an all time high. I can still walk, and bike, but it is starting to intefere even more, and the ankle pain has come back too. I to have my legs up for as long time as possible, the last days i have rested 10 hours minimum in the daytime, practicing RICE.

Should I call my doc to get an earlier appointment? I called her today to ask for advice, based on this story, she assumed it was shin splints and told me to stretch.

What do you think it is?  
I may add that i am a hypochondriac, and somewhere inside me keeps telling me it could be bone cancer, and I really hate that, so I try to stay optimistic, and think about the rarity of it, albeit I am on strong Immunosuppressants. The thought of it being cancer and just assuming it is something else makes me extremely anxious.

TL;DR: Dull shin pain began after running pb (15th jan), stopped running about a week after, pain persisted, and after 8 days of skiing (1st feb-9th feb), has gotten accompanied by a sharp pain in the bone. (Pic of location: [https://imgur.com/jNpPV1r](https://imgur.com/jNpPV1r)) from friday it started getting worse. I have an appointment on the 26th feb, should i call for an earlier? I am afraid this is more serious than a shin splint, maybe a stress fracture, maybe bone cancer...

A lot of overtime work and I ate a lot of garbage food like pizza and chocolate. 

I now feel kinda gassy sometimes but I think the rest is closer to normal now.... Also.. about 4 weeks ago I went to the washroom and saw a couple of bright spots of red on the toilet paper that went away after a few wipes. I have gone to my family doctor and I did an ultrasound and all was fine. Despite that Iâ€™m convinced I might have colon cancer after reading online and despite my family history of colon issues my doctor doesnâ€™t want to do a colonoscopy. 

I dunno what to do.... ",1
Tetanus from a staple I stapled my finger last week with my stapler at my desk at my office. It bled a tad and I immediately went into freak out mode.  I called my Dr who said to go get a tetanus shot since my last one was 2012.  I went to a local urgent care and got the shot. I am so freaked out I have tetanus even though it had not been 10 years since my last shot and I went to get a booster. Health anxiety is the absolute worst.,1

"HA Hopelessness I have had health related anxiety issues for the past 5 months, and just when they seem to be getting better and I have a solid week, it all comes crashing down again.

At the beginning I was convinced that I was going to have a heart attack, then it was a pulmonary embolism, and now I think I have some kind of emphysema or lung cancer (I used to smoke and it haunts me). I can't make it stop, and it seems like once I handle one issue and a doctor clears me, my brain just latches onto another new thing and starts a new cycle of tracking symptoms, googling and doctors appointments. Like jesus fucking christ, enough already! It makes me feel so hopeless and sad, I don't want to go through this every day. It's like my own personal hell loop, because I feel like I can't trust my own brain to make rational decisions about anything. 

How do you all cope with the hopelessness and feeling of being trapped in your own head all the time? At this point the general anxiety about having HA is almost as bad as the HA itself. ",1
"Painful, hard lump behind ear.... Mastoiditis? I have this painful, hard lump on my mastoid process (that hard bone that's right behind the ear) on only my right side. I literally just noticed it about an hour ago. It's tender to the touch and now I can feel dull pain in that spot without touching it. I have no idea if it's been there all day, I didn't notice it at all.

The closest thing I can find that it could be is mastoiditis. I have no other symptoms other than the fact that I noticed my hearing was slightly worse than my right ear a couple of times in today (before I noticed the bump).

I'm extremely scared and I don't have any support, everyone around me writes things off as nothing. I keep reading things about needing antibiotics through an IV but I can't find very many people talking about mastoiditis... and obviously I don't even know if that's what it is exactly.

"Health Anxiety / Phobias I had posted this in the general anxiety sub, someone pointed me to this sub in the comments so I'm cross-posting here: 

I'm new here.  I've suffered with anxiety for as long as I can remember, but it took an existential crisis for me to seek treatment about 10 years ago.  I've been medicated ever since.  The meds definitely help me feel more ""normal"", but I'm never 100% without anxiety.  It's still always there.  

I have some chronic health problems, and after suffering for years (see a pattern here?) I have finally gotten up the nerve to try to figure out what is wrong.  For years I've told myself my symptoms are just anxiety related (IBS, body pain, fatigue, extreme migraines, etc.)  It has now gotten to the point where I'm sick more often than not, I'm missing a lot of work and I'm not able to be a good mother or wife.  I'm spending most of my time in the fetal position in bed.  I'm in pain all of the time, sometimes so severe I can barely move.  I'm losing weight without trying.  I feel like I'm losing my grip on reality. 

The problem is, I am really freaked out by doctors and all the associated medical tests/procedures.   I have a GP who handles my anxiety meds, and I see her regularly, but I am awful at getting tests done and awful at seeing specialists .... even though I know logically that I need to go do these things to find out what is wrong with me so I can get better.  

In a moment of bravery, I made myself appointments with all of the specialists I've been told to see over the years... gastroenterologist, neurologist, rheumatologist, dentist and oral surgeon.   I've gone to a couple of the appts and of course all of them want me to get tests done or bloodwork done.  I feel paralyzed when I think about getting those things done.  For example, I have orders for bloodwork.  I just have to walk into the lab and let them draw blood.... super easy and no big deal.  I have driven myself there 5 times in the last week and been unable to force myself to walk through the door to get it done.  I break out in a sweat, panic, and get back in the car and leave.  Then I spend the rest of the day hating myself for it.   Feeling like an idiot because I didn't get it done.  

My GI doctor also ordered an ultrasound, which I forced myself to do (I've had two kids and knew US were easy, so this didn't freak me out as much).  However, she called me back to tell me that my US results are abnormal and that they might need to do a biopsy... so of course now I am absolutely freaking out.  

Does anyone else have this problem?  I feel paralyzed and terrified over the simplest things and hate myself for it.  I need to stop being such a coward and get this stuff done so I can figure out why I am so sick and try to fix it. ",1
"How to resist the tentation to search for symptoms on the internet? My counselor told me that all this searching on the internet to reassure myself it's only feeding my anxiety. She actually described this circle with a metaphor of a drug addict's addiction. So I'm trying to resist my impulses to look up for symptoms and I find it so hard, I spend 8+ hours in front of a computer for work and it's just so tempting to open a Google search which will lead me to WebMD to autodiagnose myself with MS, RA or some other nasty stuff.

"Falling/dropping sensation multiple times a day. Anxiety? Hi there. I'm anxious about this kind of new ""symptom"" I'm having right now... Its like a falling or dropping sensation, mostly when I'm sitting but sometimes happens to me while I walk around. I can feel it during less than a second, it feels like when you use an elevator to go up or down in a building (you know, HAT feeling you have when the elevetor starts to move). Anyone can relate? It's really strange, but I don't even move when it happens, it's just some kind of ""sensation"".",1
"Mono nightmare Towards the beginning of 2019 I began feeling something weird in my throat, as if a ball of mucus was stuck there. I thought it was allergies but never took any allergy medication. Fast forward to 1 week ago where I'm following a terrible flipped sleep schedule going to sleep at 10am and waking up at 6pm. I woke up at 4pm one day and was so tired that I ended up falling asleep at 10pm. After getting 9 hours of sleep I still remained tired throughout the day. I assumed it was due to my sudden shift in sleep schedules but the daytime fatigue continued. Eventually, I scheduled a physical exam to see what was going on, all while assuming the absolute worst case scenario. The doctor brought up mono as a possibility but I didn't think much of it.

&amp;#x200B;

Again fast forward to today, I receive a call from the doctor saying that my bloodwork came back positive for mono. I was shocked. But for some reason, I've been having a heart/chest pain that pops up for a few seconds at different times throughout the day and almost as it were to perfectly coincide with my diagnosis. Now there are some complications with mono such as heart inflammation however they are said to be quite rare. My hypochondria is immediately assuming that I am one of those rare cases and have developed a viral heart disease. Does anyone have an experience similar to this with mono? I would love to hear about it. ",0
"Does anyone else have a consistent fear of being allergic to nuts even after repeatedly consuming them?

"Does anyone have shaking/rigid muscle movements? Like, the motion isn't ""smooth?"" It's hard to describe, but say if you raise your arm up and come back down, it isn't in one continuous motion. It's shaky almost? Right now I have it in every muscle and it worries me.",1
"Iâ€™ve been managing my health anxiety pretty well! .....until today So, Iâ€™m on 150mg of Zoloft daily, along with Lamictal (not certain about the dosage). Today, I was taking my daily pills but I accidentally took an extra pill, which I guess would mean I took 250mg. My mom called the pharmacist who said I should be fine but to look out for fainting. Ironically, I felt lightheaded just seconds after realizing Iâ€™d taken more than the prescribed dose. So Iâ€™m guessing that was anxiety because no pill affects you that fast (as far as Iâ€™m aware).

But, technically, it still is an overdose, but a small one. Whenever I drink water, it feels weird on my throat and thereâ€™s a tickle in my throat (though that could be a mix of allergies and anxiety). And when I got up at first I felt dizzy.

I looked it up and it says that 200mg is usually the max dosage. I took 50mg more. Iâ€™m afraid to sleep or anything. This happened around 5 hours ago. If Iâ€™d overdosed on a fatal level, would I have exhibited severe and obvious symptoms by now? Iâ€™m just so paranoid now ",1

"What triggers your palpitations and what do they feel like? So Iâ€™ve been dealing with intermittent palpitations for the past 6 months or so. I havenâ€™t had an EKG done yet just because Iâ€™m in between doctors and my psychiatrist (MD not therapist) said she wasnâ€™t worried about them and thought they were fine when I told her about them. 
From what she told me and what Iâ€™ve learned, I think Iâ€™ve been feeling ectopic beats. For me, it feels kind of like my stomach drops- like when youâ€™re in an elevator going down. I can also feel like the air is pushed out of my lungs and I feel a super faint little tap in my chest, then my heartbeat goes back to normal. I sometimes feel adrenaline and lightheadedness right when it first happens, but Iâ€™m not sure if thatâ€™s a physical response to the palpitation or if itâ€™s my anxiety reacting. Iâ€™ve never felt a run of any, itâ€™s always just a single missed beat that I feel (when theyâ€™re bad I get 3-5 per day at most). Iâ€™ve been trying really hard to figure out what triggers them for me, and it seems to be correlated with breathing variance, stress, and posture. For instance, I feel them most often if Iâ€™m talking quickly and run low on breath and then take in a quick breath. I also feel them sometimes when bending over or bending backward.  Also, if Iâ€™ve been sitting down and then stand up and stretch I can feel a tightness in my whole chest area and my heart will beat slow and hard and I can feel an ectopic if I move too quickly or breathe weird during this. I wanted to know if anyone else has these same triggers, and if not then what are they and how do the palps feel? Iâ€™m working on not worrying so much about mine, but itâ€™s comforting to know other people experience similar things. ",1
"Avoiding doctor office calls and scheduling appointments I am at a point where Iâ€™m just too tired and bogged down to keep making more appointments.

You need to call us.â€ I know they are abnormal, I have eyes, I can read. Iâ€™m just too tired right now. On top of the doctors I have debt collections from surgeries out the wazoo calling all day. I just hide from my phone on my room, probably getting sicker. I just canâ€™t mentally and physically keep up with the constant anxiety and trips everywhere. Im afraid of reaching out to these people too, since they are angry and frustrated with me for being difficult to contact. Everything about it makes me want to panic and crawl in a hole.

"So annoyed with myself...health anxiety resurgence Hey guys

So annoyed with myself, even though I guess it isnâ€™t really my fault, I used to have pretty bad health anxiety a few years ago. It started to subside somewhat after I got a scan done after I felt a lump, it was just a cyst. Right around that time I was also immigrating from the UK to the US so my life got super busy and the health anxiety virtually went away. Iâ€™ve been in the US for almost two years now and havenâ€™t really had any â€˜bigâ€™ health worries since I got the scan done in England years ago...until this week. My wife passed onto me, I guess some sort of virus, and I had flu like symptoms - of course, a lymph node on my neck has swollen - as is pretty topical with stuff like that - and Iâ€™m now convinced I have lymphoma. 0 to 60 in about a week, unbelievable. This time feels different though, when this sort of stuff happened in the past my rational thought was completely obscured to the point where any logical or rational thought would immediately be dismissed in favor of the worst case scenario, but this time Iâ€™m well aware how irrational Iâ€™m being, and Iâ€™m well aware that itâ€™s most likely just due to this infection. But Iâ€™m still worrying. I made the mistake of Googling it, and although Google does say that with cancerous lumps in the neck theyâ€™re typically immovable, mine is movable, Iâ€™m still panicking!",1

I noticed whenever I see something like a friend being diagnosed with pulmonary embolism that Iâ€™ll look it up and then think I have it, or feel a normal bodily sensation and get fixated on it and make everything  worse until Iâ€™m in panic mode. I would have to say the worst thing is being dizzy, I feel like Iâ€™m constantly dizzy most places leaving my house and it makes me uncomfortable and fear Iâ€™ll pass out although this wouldnâ€™t happen bc my BP is normal at those times or high if anything.

"Anxiety the cause of fatigue and other symptoms? Hey guys! Normally I try to avoid seeking reassurance as much as possible, but right now Iâ€™m just too scared, so I feel the need to share. Itâ€™s quite a lot, so please bear with me. 

Iâ€™m a guy who has experienced all kinds of vague symptoms for about one and a half year.   It all started when I experienced dizziness and nausea while exercising, which was strange because I was a young and sporty guy. I then started experiencing the following symptoms on a daily basis:

- chest pains/palpitations
- dizziness/feeling off-balance
- feeling like I canâ€™t take a full breath
- loss of appetite, felt sick after one bite of food
- feeling like I would pass out (without actually passing out)
- worsening of symptoms in heat/cold
- nervousness, anxiety, panic attacks

I am especially worried about my heart and have had several ECGâ€™s, 5 day Holter, 2 stress tests and an echocardiogram. Apart from PACâ€™s/PVCâ€™s, which my cardiologist says are benign, nothing bad was found. The diagnosis was hypochondria/anxiety. On the one hand it sounds believable to me, as I have experienced social anxiety and body dysmorphia in the past. On the other hand, I canâ€™t accept that itâ€™s just anxiety because of the severity of the symptoms. Almost a year of therapy have not improved the symptoms much either.

I donâ€™t experience full-blown panic attacks or chest pains as often as I used to. Instead I have been getting more palpitations and heavy fatigue. The fatigue is a relatively new symptom that started 4 months ago, and it scares me the most. I usually have energy in the morning, but from around 12 the fatigue sets in, preventing me from doing anything. When I googled it, I found out fatigue is linked to heart disease, making me even more anxious. My doctor says that it is due to adrenal fatigue and lack of activity, which finally leads to my question...

Can such heavy fatigue really be caused by anxiety or a lack of activity (I am scared to exercise and donâ€™t leave the house much)? Is it possible that Iâ€™m just experiencing some kind of burn-out from being anxious for a over a year? I find it so hard to believe, since Iâ€™m also tired on days that Iâ€™m seemingly not anxious.

Thanks for bearing with my long story!

Cheers!

"Can health anxiety cause real symptoms? Hi, firstly I wanna say that I am a 20 year old male and I think I have developed severe health anxiety in the last 4 months, I woke up one morning with an awful left back ache spreading to my chest, left shoulder and arm. 
Went to hospital they told me itâ€™s a muscle cramp gave me naproxen and told me to go see a physio if it doesnâ€™t get any better.

I wasnâ€™t getting any better after few weeks I started feeling really shit had fever, dizziness, blurry vision, body aches, awful stomach cramps, bloating, chills, sweats and back ache. 
Went to the doctors got an ultrasound done and was diagnosed with a kidney infection had antibiotics for a week  and they told me itâ€™s clear after a check up. 

At this stage I was still getting daily stomach cramps and tightness especially in the left side of stomach, hip and shoulder, dizzy spells and blurry vision. 

After weeks of not caring the symptoms have improved now I only get tightness in left side of stomach/back and light bloating, sometimes it spreads to the hip or to the shoulder and I sometimes get dizzy spells but all the other symptoms are going. 

I wanna say that I constantly worry about the symptoms as it is there everyday and I havenâ€™t been eating enough because of it all. Iâ€™ve done so many tests at my doctors as well as few scans and everything comes up clear and they say Iâ€™m healthy although I feel shit.

Do you think I have developed health anxiety over this due to constant stress and worry and this is what causes the feeling of tightness and bloating that I get everyday? 

Has anyone experienced any physical symptoms similar to this due to health anxiety and constant worry or stress? ",1

"Can health anxiety cause cold-like symptoms? Hey guys!

Let me start off by saying that I suffer from pretty strong health anxiety but have recently started therapy to deal with it.

Three weeks ago, the very week I started therapy, I caught a cold. It was a very difficult week as I pretty much thought I was dying.

Anyway, it has been two weeks since it has passed and since then, Iâ€™ve had pain in my throat on and off, moving in different places in my throat (sometimes the left side, sometimes the right side, sometimes the soft palate, sometimes nothing at all). Yesterday, after being very stressed out about some work things, the pain came back in the right side of my throat pretty strong. This morning I woke up and now the left side is hurting and I have a ton of mucus insiste my nose too.

Could my brain really be making all of this up? Does anyone suffer from throat pain from health anxiety?

Sorry for the reassurance post guys, Iâ€™m just really tired of thinking about all this and I never google anything because I feel like Iâ€™ll start feeling everything I read.",1
"Its funny how HA works Lately we've had a small problem with rats behind one of our walls at home. We through some poison into the hole in which they climb. No biggie.

So today my dog was being more friendly and excited than usual. My fiance and I spent some time playing with her since he was in such a good mood. She licked my face a ton while we were playing (the dog, not my fiance lol).

5 minutes after she calmed down, my fiance eventually said ""did she catch a rat or something?"". Instantly I realized that if she did, she might have been poisoned by the poisoned rat and her licking could have poisoned me. I was fine until I thought of that. Suddenly I got dizzy and nauseous. 

HA works like that. Unless we have the idea, we don't worry about our health. Our symptoms are caused from our overactive brains. But I'm sure you knew this already. Just thought I'd give more evidence of irrational behavior. ",1
"Scared of bad diseases and death in the young ages Hello everyone
I'm a medical student (22 y/o) and it's about 2 year that I'm suffering from anxiety about my health. 

I think about my body and symptoms  
almost every hour of the day. I'm always scared about that i have a bad disease and will it kill me or something.

I usually experience physical symptoms and I can't really find out whether this symptoms are real or only because of my anxiety.
Over the past 2 years, I experienced lots of symptoms all over my body (now I'm experiencing stomach problems and sleep problems) visited lots of doctors and took lots of medicine. Now its for a few months that i started to feel depressed and lost my motivations. Don't now what to do at all.

I will be happy if you share some ideas. Tnx",1
I'm freaking out Yesterday I was hanging out with my buddy things haven't been good for either of us. I told him how two people that I knew died this week and my great aunt tested positive for cancerous cells . His birthday is coming up and he saw how depressed I was and wanted to smoke weed with me. I haven't smoked weed in a while and said screw it we were smoking I went to the bathroom I come out and find out his mom took a hit. Now I didn't know this and I know they smoke together my HA has been under control but unfortunately Now my mind is running all over the place panicking worrying about diseases. Now I'm not saying they have diseases I can't stop worrying about it. For example we were using a bowl and a bong we were passing to each other now I'm worrying about shit like Hepatitis or HIV and stuff like that. Again I'm not saying they have because when I did smoke with them before I was perfectly fine but my HA won't stop me from over thinking and going worst case scenario.,1

"Scared of Crohn's Disease I had a canker sore in my mouth two weeks ago, it has healed now but I just thought ""what if it comes back"". I have no idea if I have had this feeling for a long time but just now noticed it that I kinda feel like the roof of my mouth is burning and it stops when I don't pay attention to it. I have always had some problems with my stomach, they have gotten better in last two years (male, 19 y/o now). I have had a gastroscopy before but never gotten a colonoscopy because that makes me anxious. Gastroscopy showed that I have no reflux and everything looks good, biopsies from my duodenum came back normal, no coeliac disease or other diseases. I just can't stop worrying if I have an IBD and that is what is causing my mouth symptoms. Would Crohn's disease show on the biopsies taken from my duodenum? I just feel like it would be real unlikely because no-one in my family never have had an IBD and I don't smoke (Apparently smokers are twice as likely to develop Crohn's than non-smokers). ",1
"Lumps on neck and head now. Okay so first of all thank you for reading this, I am struggling with bad anxiety right now. 

I have had two lumps on the side of my neck for 2 years now and have been told in the past by a doctor that they were nothing. I was put on antibiotics (which didn't seem to help) and sent away. I recently had them checked out again and the doctor ordered an ultrasound (which I have yet to go to) to make sure they weren't cancer. I have zero symptoms otherwise.

 Fast forward to now I have a larger lump on the back left side of my scalp. I'm trying to tell myself it's just a cyst but the anxious pattern seeking side of me is having a hard time time letting it go.  It's larger than the other two and is  hard and hurts a little when I apply pressure. 

There are a few causes I can think of 

1. It's just a cyst, and completely unrelated to my other two swollen lymph nodes. My fathet has a history of cysts, which may account for mine.

2. I'm pretty sure I remember hitting my head on something about a week ago, so it could just be a bruise of sorts. (memory isn't clear)

3. Cancer. I'm gonna die, hit the panic button, ect...

4. I recently have been having allergies or a cold which could be due to an infection which could be making my lymph nodes react. 


This is the way my anxious mind sees it: I must have cancer because there is now a third lump to add on the other two I've had for years. I've left it untreated for so long that I'm scared to even go to a doctor. Now it must be spreading to my brain which would probably make it inoperable. I will get brain cancer and die at 19 due to my lack of action.

I'm honestly having trouble deciphering hypochondria from reality.

I'm hoping someone besides myself could make a determination as to whether or not I'm blowing this out of proportion. Thank you.

"Scared, spotting My period is late, I masturbated doing clitoral stimulation only, I had blood after. I thought maybe it trigged my period.  Today it stopped, no blood. It seemed like spotting instead of a period.. I also had spotting in the beginning of the month after clitorial masturbation. It has happened a few times after clitorial masturbation.

"HA with starting new medications A few years ago, I was placed on a mood stabilizer to treat BPD and the first night that I took it I got extremely dizzy, my heart rate spiked, and I spent the next two days in bed unable to think straight because everything was just fuzzy and I couldn't concentrate or find the energy to function.

Ever since, I've been *petrified* of starting new medications. A few times now, my psychiatrist has put me on something and I didn't even start taking it because I would take to the internet to double-check possible side effects and suddenly become too afraid to. I always worry starting something new, wondering if this one will have another frightening effect, if I'll have an allergic reaction, if it'll interfere with my heart condition, etc - basically, I always end up terrified to start taking something, because I'm convinced it will be dangerous, or at least will make me feel worse than whatever it's treating.

Today, after seeing my psychiatrist again, I've been given a new prescription, this time for Strattera to treat the ADHD I just got diagnosed with very recently. Strattera is the only/safest option for me right now, as stimulants definitely will aggravate my heart condition. But so many people online (I peeked around /r/ADHD and a few other places) say it made them feel absolutely horrible, with more side effects than benefits, and now I'm back to being terrified to take it.

"'Ice-Pick Headaches / year long' Hey!

So I was wondering whether some of you could help me out. For the last year, I have been experiencing a weird sensation at the back/top of my head, the closest thing I can describe it to being an 'Ice-Pick Headache'. Originally, I was having it a few times a week, and I would get these sensations a few times a day, lasting only 2-5 seconds. However, this has now reduced to once a week on average. During the last year, I have been to the doctors about this issue a few times, mentioning the almost 'pinching' sensation that occurs. However, on none of these occasions have any follow-up appointments been scheduled, each doctor suggesting there is absolutely nothing to worry about and suggesting they could be a symptom of anxiety or tension. For a few months, it hasn't worried me as much but has been in the back of my head (quite literally!), and I decided to make another appointment for today. Again, I was told the same thing, but was prescribed with an anti-inflammatory medicine.

Have any of you experienced similar symptoms, and do you have any advice?

fyi, 21 year old male who has never had real issues with headaches/migraines.

Much appreciated.",1
"Freaking out over HIV So a little over a year ago I was hooking up with this guy. We had unprotected sex (vaginal and anal).

I also had to get surgery to remove an ovary due to a cyst and they did all the general blood work then and everything looked fine. Fast forward to two weeks ago, I had a swollen lymph node but didnâ€™t feel sick. Ignored it. I woke up this morning to a rash on my breast and I donâ€™t know where it came from. It doesnâ€™t hurt or itch itâ€™s just red. I went to urgent care this morning and she told me I was fine and couldnâ€™t feel my lymphnodes but to come back in three days if the rash doesnâ€™t go away. I had just gotten another general health panel done on my blood a month ago and was told I was completely healthy. Well after doing research I found out that general health panels donâ€™t screen for HIV. So now Iâ€™m freaking out. I had the lymphnode, and now the rash and I think I have tongue thrush. Not severe or anything but my tongue definitely looks whiter than usual. Iâ€™m going to get tested this week but Iâ€™m so fucking scared.

"Convinced something is wrong with my head/brain I posted this to r/askdocs already but figured l'd share here too.

I'll start by saying l got diagnosed with severe GAD anxiety about a year ago, and l've noticed l've become a huge hypochondriac since then. Lately l've been noticing a few things that have me convinced there's something wrong.

One is that when l run my hand over my head l feel a lot of hard bumps/divits on my skull that l don't remember always being there, and l haven't hit my head recently. I know it's normal to have a few small bumps, but I have one on the top of my head that seems out of the ordinary and l don't know if that should be of concern or not.

The other is that I will randomly get sharp bursts of pain in isolated areas of my head that feel like bad headaches, but only last for like a minute or so. This has been scaring me into thinking l might have brain problems/tumors. I also will feel ""shakey"" but it's only in my head and not all over. I sometimes will get slight numbing/tingling sensations on my head, ears, and side of face. 
Like l mentioned before, l have anxiety so l know some of these could just be anxiety related issues/symptoms, but it seems like something is wrong to me. I don't want to waste my money in getting scans of my brain if unnecessary, but I still am concerned.
I'm a 21 year old female, overall healthy besides the anxiety and mild depression. Any feedback or concerns would be greatly appreciated!",1

My legs were burning and I felt like I had to like drag them. After that I freaked out about what could be wrong with me.

"I donâ€™t understand why my sickness wonâ€™t go away. Iâ€™m starting to think I might have neck or throat cancer. Two months ago I went to the doctor due to a cough and a caught up stuffy head Iâ€™ve had for literally 2-3 months straight.

I got a blood test taken. I also had constant tiredness. 

I got acid reflux then in between all of this which I also got medicine for. Itâ€™s cured now.

"Dealing with health anxiety for years... and how Im learning to move on from it Im no expert and I know everyone is different but Iâ€™ve come a long way with my health anxiety and wanted to share a little of what I learned.  
(On mobile, excuse format and typos)

I once read something along the lines of â€œour brain believes everything we tell it, so if we start filling it with doubt and anxiety, we create a world that is simply not trueâ€ 

A year ago and I was telling myself every little symptom meant imminent death, I worried about brain cancer, breast cancer, blood cloths, etc etc etc. 

Im still in the process of completely desensitize myself from the most minimal sensations and Im still trying to learn how to really understand what my body is trying to tell me, this is kind of how I learned to deal with it (again, I know not everyone is the same but hopefully this will be useful for someone) 

1. If I can distract myself from the sensation or discomfort then its anxiety, I call them â€œsensationsâ€ because any little thing I feel I wanna convince myself is pain even if its not. I try to ignore it if thats the case. My doctor always told me small sensations or symptoms are not a sign of anything serious.

2. If its interrupting your day to day then take something for your symptom and try to move on, (eg., you have a sore throat then get something specifically for that) 

3. If over the counter meds donâ€™t do it and its well over a week or so then Iâ€™ll call my Doctor explain whats going on and see if I can come in for some answers and peace of mind. 

If you have multiple terrible symptoms then of course go check with your doctor asap. But the main thing is, breathe friend. Donâ€™t freak out immediately, donâ€™t google about it, try to accept the thought and the sensations as exactly that, thoughts and sensations and nothing more, theyâ€™re not a sign of anything. 

Ironically, life is not guaranteed for anybody no matter what, but looking for symptoms constantly means youâ€™re wasting something you want to hold on to so desperately. 

Think about that, I do it everyday. ",1

"any advice for someone who's scared of taking an ultrasound and its test results? hello! 

this coming saturday, im going to have to have a whole abdomen ultrasound to check why ive been feeling nasty symptoms in the upper (stomach) and lower (large intestine? uterus?) abdomen for about 6 weeks now.

my initial fear was that i was pregnant... 3 negative test results later + even having my period, i still doubt myself -- what if that wasnt a period? what if the pain ive been feeling on the lower side is actually a baby?

though maybe... the lower pain is from the constipation and how im having trouble with my digestive system (i...really want to, for the lack of a better term, poop now) maybe high levels of stress can cause that? someone please enlighten me. haha

my grandmother is accompanying me on saturday because she knows the doctor. i have 2 fears:
1) what if im pregnant? -- illogical, at this point. but i fear that the worse outcome will happen and i dont want my grandmother to know first... ive actually been really conscious of my abdominal area, i keep looking at it in the mirror and nowadays i feel full and sometimes there's a pain somewhere.

2) what if i have an illness i never even thought of? -- i really dont want to die yet, or have cancer...

"my neck is constantly cracking! so my neck has been constantly cracking for a long time now, but now its even more frequent than it used to be. 

i can also MOVE bits and pieces in the back of my neck, which feels like small pieces of bone. 

i saw a doctor for this, she basically diagnosed me as overly anxious about my health, that it is all a mental thing. i agree in this because i AM always anxious about my health.

when my neck cracks, which is with many movements, not just occasionally but VERY frequently, i dont really feel any pain but it does worry me a lot.

my neck cracking gets worse when i am in certain positions or if i sit down on a chair for a long time.

sometimes with the pains i feel, like sharp stabbing pains occasionally in my head or wherever it may be, i am starting to feel overly anxious about them because i wonder if it could be because of my neck.

im only 17 but i have very bad posture and a sedentary lifestyle for many years now.

i am mostly concerned about the bits and pieces that i can shift in the back of my neck, they feel like tiny pieces of bone and i can move them around. everyone ive asked about this does not relate to what im saying at all! 

i also get headaches nearly every day, i have a bit of scoliosis, and tmj, so i wonder if this is related at all.

i just dont feel like this is normal, and its really making me anxious lately, so if anyone else experiences constant cracking and crunching in their neck tell me! and are you able to move little pieces that feel like bone in the back of your neck? 

if anyone can help me alleviate this anxiety i will be extremely grateful!",1
"Tell me your success stories Quick Bio:
My Dad was diagnosed with MS when I was 23, shortly after having my first baby. It rocked my world. I saw the strongest man in my life quickly deteriorating and it hit me that illnesses happen to young people. This kicked off health anxiety for me and Iâ€™ve been struggling ever since. Iâ€™ve been convinced that Iâ€™ve had MS, Parkinsonâ€™s, neuro diseases. lots of various cancers. Iâ€™m a compulsive â€˜checkerâ€™ if I feel a lump or bump. I check it constantly. Iâ€™ve had panic attacks that last for days. Most of these symptoms have always gone away with starting and restarting ssriâ€™s.  Basically, my anxiety has given me symptoms that mimic diseases. My mind is obviously not healthy, as if I even hear the word cancer, I can feel the anxiety build. If people I know are going through something health related, or even if I see a young person going through cancer treatment, it triggers it. Itâ€™s even branching to my kids. Every headache or complaint, I start panicking about something worse than a headache or virus. I canâ€™t sleep, I obsess and theyâ€™re starting to notice my compulsions and worries. Itâ€™s entirely illogical and overall just really bad for my health. I donâ€™t want to live like this. I hate being on SSRIâ€™s. I have sexual side effects and I donâ€™t feel like myself. I think they help, but even on them Iâ€™m susceptible to panic over things. 

Iâ€™ve tried meditating, medications, yoga, exercise. Iâ€™ve overhauled my diet. I lift weights and cardio 3x a week. I use CBD oil. 

My question: is this a life long thing? Has anyone overcome this and lived more normally? Has therapy helped you? And if so, how? I just donâ€™t see how talking about it will help. How have you overcome this? Iâ€™m so tired. ",1
"Hypochondria as an early symptom of dementia? I decided to take a break from scaring myself to death with medical craziness online and (for once) actually wanted to learn about Hypochondria (I guess you could say it was an eye opening moment where I, myself, saw myself from a logical standpoint). 

As I sifted through the Google pages, I ended up coming across a slew of articles relating to Hypochondria being one of the earliest signs of Frontotemporal Lobe Dementia and Lewy Body Dementia. My first initial reaction was complete anger. I had abused my Google privileges for so long, looking at the scariest possible diseases. The one time I do exactly what people have been telling me to do (""dude, look up what ANXIETY does to your body and mind, not this"") I get forced back into hell. 

As you can imagine, I checked it out. There were actually many articles and case reports regarding it that it kinda scared me. I had been worried specifically about dementia for the past month for a bunch of odd-and-end reasons..and then Google relays the term in reference to my hypochondria/anxiety...? It is the coincidence now that is flipping me out and confirming my fear even more. That is some bizarre..not even intentional coincidence, dont you think? 

How do you even distinguish the difference between hypochondria as a VERY early symptom of dementia vs hypochondria because you are a hypochondriac?",1

Straight down the rabbit hole, googling away... heart pumping, i bet i have leukemia, im certain, i donâ€™t know what else it could be...

I have NO symptoms of why it could be swollen, and the worst thing is i donâ€™t really know how long its been like that for, i just felt it while rubbing my neck one day, about the size of a cashew..

About a week ago I discovered a swollen (what I presume to be) a lymph node on my upper thigh/groin crease area. About the size of a grape, hard and moveable.

"Coping Methods Backfired Hi all, just hoping to get some feedback on how to proceed. 

I got an IUD in mid January, and had my follow up ultra sound in February. 

A few weeks after getting the iud, I started feeling this strange twinge in my lower left pelvis. Of course, having gone through this countless times, I began to do what Iâ€™ve been working on with my counselor, which is essentially using mindfulness to talk myself off the ledge of thinking I was dying. 

I actually felt relatively calm while I was having my exam, but then my doctor tells me I have a complex cyst on my left ovary, and I felt anxiety come crashing down on me. 

The ultrasound was 2/7 of this year, and since that day, I canâ€™t stop obsessing over this cyst, and Iâ€™m determined itâ€™s cancer and that Iâ€™m dying. 

My doctor even said it was nothing to stress about, and that Iâ€™d have a follow up in 2 months to see if itâ€™s changed/gone away. That hasnâ€™t helped, and Iâ€™m still so scared. 

Itâ€™s too the point where Iâ€™m getting heart palpitations, and every twinge of my body makes me feel like my ovarian cancer has spread to wherever Iâ€™m feeling it. 

Anyone have any advice? I feel completely at a loss, because I feel like I can no longer rely on my coping method.",1

"Weird heartbeat - Anxiety symptom ? Hi guys, 

I am looking for someone that would have/had the same thing than I. 
I have been recently diagnosed with spasmophilia/severe anxiety (it all begin a month ago when i suddenly had a panic attack right before bed, and i am pretty sure it was heart related) 
I have been scared for a while to have any heart disease and i am obviously completely freaked out about sudden death (heart attack and stuff). 
I have been quite deep into anxiety, i could not walk without freaking out and my heart rate was going crazy ! 

I has dizziness, headaches, palpitations, nausea, tiredness, chest pain, blurry vision, heavy stomach feeling, pressure in my throat and neck, an oppressing feeling in my throat like i was suffocating, hot flash and short breath.

Doctors said : we found nothing, you are fine. 

Yeah but nothing stopped ... how can they tell me i have nothing when i feel so bad ? 

Anyway, back to other doctor : you have spasmophilia known as severe anxiety/stress. What happened ? I have no idea ...

My cardiologist gave me propanolol after running exams that all came back good ! 

I feel better yes, i can go to work, talk, walk. 
Nevertheless i still feel oppressed, i have shortbreath, crazy stomach pain (i think it is acid reflux but not sure), it feels like i am swallowing too much air, and i have those weird heart palpitations where all of a sudden it misses a beat and then burst in a new beat, it nearly cut my breath ! (But again cardiologist said i had nothing after an echograpghy and a 24h ECG). 

It needs to stop. Everytime i think i am getting better, something else appears and makes me feel down again. 

Sorry for the long post guys, but ill take any advise you Â´ll have for me !

"Wanted to share one of my coping methods in case any of you find it helpful Recently I've been thinking a lot about about my health anxiety and I think one of the main reasons why I am so afraid of contracting whatever disease it happens to be on any given week, is because I automatically catastrophize the situation. 

If I think I might have breast cancer I automatically think it will kill me. I imagine saying my last goodbyes to my family and friends and think of all the things I will never achieve in my life because I've died young. To reassure myself, I tell myself that I'm making it up it my head, I don't have cancer, it's so unlikely at my age etc. This reassurance is only fleeting before I find another 'symptom' and the cycle continues.

But lately I've been realising that one of the main problems is that I underestimate my ability to cope with health problems. There are hundreds of thousands of cancer survivors who end up living long and happy lives. People who are HIV positive can live relatively normal lives despite their illness thanks to modern medicine. Having an illness does not mean the end of the world. 

By reframing my thinking when reassuring myself from 'I don't have x disease, I'm OK' to 'I probably don't have x disease, but if I do I know I will find a way to cope with it and I will be ok', I have found that health anxiety worries have come up less frequently as the intrusive thoughts have less to hold on to.

"Do you ever just feel one lymph node? Then you feel more and more? Seems like itâ€™s common for someone to feel lymph nodes unilaterally, especially on the neck. In my case it has always been the right side of my neck.
Iâ€™ve felt one below my lower right jaw for several years. 

I started feeling again and finding more and theyâ€™re all on the right side still. A nice little stiff one around the posterior cervical area. Then today I found a pretty big soft one in the supraclavicular area (feels very long and narrow like an oversized Mike n Ike). Now Iâ€™ve freaked myself out. 

I was never worried about my lymph nodes until now since Iâ€™ve been able to feel more of them in a descending pattern on one side only. I suppose the good thing is that theyâ€™re not big enough that you could see the lumps in a picture or mirror. 

I seldom have an intense itch attack on my lower legs and abdomen. Iâ€™d say just a few occasions every couple months, brought on by some physical activity. Last stomach itch I remember happened after a bike ride at night in the summer.

Edit: Had a pretty intense scratching session on my calf after I said this.

Night sweats have happened but are rare as well. They always seem to happen when I cover myself up in a certain throw blanket, so I switched to a more silky blanket and reduced the problems. 

Thinking way too ahead now, I know most common lymphomas are treatable but itâ€™s a matter if my insurance will cover the treatment and what I must do if they wonâ€™t. I *could* just hope itâ€™s nothing though instead of stressing about potentially nonexistent financial burdens. ",1
"I can't believe this So my health anxiety was somewhat under control, I went through a full course of CBT, my symptoms had persisted for so long that surely I would be dead by now (3 years) if my brain tumour was real, so it was clearly time to get my life back on track. Well...

I've tried, I caught up with old friends, made some new ones, actually have some hope for the future for the first time in a long time, even been trying to get a girlfriend (I'm 22 and have never had one). Turns out my health anxiety hates this, I'm not allowed to be happy because to be happy is to be excited for the future, something that's hard to do when your thoughts are once again racing with things you thought you had moved past. Why would I go out to the bar with friends if I'm dying, why am I mixing up words when typing, why is my leg suddenly jerking frequently, why am I even feeling motivated and confident, is this finally the personality changes that come with having a brain tumour. Anxiety is cruel but this is the cruelest thing it has done yet, preventing my ability to be happy because what's the point, I'll obviously be dead soon. 

And you know what set me off tonight? I sat down on the toilet and noticed a drop of liquid on the seat. Was it there before I sat down or did it leak out without me noticing? I must have urinary incontinence, cause brain tumours can cause that and wow it tends to be a late-stage symptom and I've had symptoms for over 3 years huh.

"Health anxiety by proxy, anyone? So I think it started last summer, when my husband got appendicitis. He denied the need to go to the ER for some time, until finally I made him call for medical help. They came, but they were unable to diagnose him, so they just gave him a pain shot and left.

It was an appendicitis, the surgery was almost at the last moment before it would burst. But it was a minor surgery and after a few days he was totally fine, he just got 3 really small scars. And know my health anxiety went fully blown out on him, because it seems if I hadn't this anxiety and the knowledge it gave me, my husband could have been in a way worse situation.

"Colon Cancer symptoms for 1.5 months Hello guys, I hope Iâ€™m in the correct sub, please direct me if Iâ€™m not. Iâ€™m 22 and have no family history of colon cancer.

Around mid January, I started having extremely large amounts of diarrhea, probably like 4-5 times a day. Within 2 weeks, I was still having diarrhea but now blood started showing up, and now every time (apart from 1-2 here and there) I have blood in my stool. Within the last week, Iâ€™m still going 4-5 times a day, but half of those are usually to pass mucus and blood, nothing else. The rest of the time I still pass mucus and blood, but with normal stool. It might be stress related because college/work is pretty hectic, but I manage and I have no other stress symptoms.

I went to my doctor around 2 weeks ago and he said there was nothing he can do, so he scheduled a GI appointment which is finally coming this Tuesday. The problem is that I read cancer stories from people my age, and they all say they initially got passed off by several doctors because of their age group, and they donâ€™t get the diagnosis until they finally get a colonoscopy, so I will make sure I get one.

"Breast cancer anxiety As the title suggests, my HA specialty is breast cancer. I do not have a family history of it; Iâ€™m 33 and live a very active, healthy life.

"Shaking HA label when you know something else is wrong Hi fellow HA friends! Iâ€™m new to this sub and Reddit in general. 33F history of HA and panic disorder, but it has been fairly well controlled for the last decade. 

Since last fall, Iâ€™ve had chest/ abdominal pain. Doctor thought it was GERD, but I havenâ€™t responded to multiple PPIâ€™s. I recently had a full cardiology workup and it was clear. Normally cardiology tests would really excite me, but this time I honestly didnâ€™t think it was my heart.

The pain is worsening and Iâ€™m so discouraged. Itâ€™s a constant burning and I canâ€™t find any relief with a bland diet or medicine. Endoscopy and abdominal ultrasound were normal. Iâ€™m beginning to think theyâ€™ll never find out whatâ€™s wrong. Itâ€™s almost to the point I want pain medicine, and thatâ€™s not me.

I do realize the impact anxiety can have, especially on the digestive system, but Iâ€™m in constant pain. It feels like thereâ€™s more to this. Iâ€™m fearful of tests continuing to come back normal, theyâ€™ll blame my anxiety and depression and Iâ€™ll continue to suffer. Thanks for listening.

"Worried about my eyesight I suffer from visual snow (I see a layer of static on my vision, especially on dark surfaces, and have a hard time seeing in dimmer light) and while it's okay enough for me to ignore it most of the time, recently it's been taking all of my attention. I feel like it's gotten worse and fear that I have some sort of disease that makes my retina deteriorate, and it's just gonna keep getting worse until I'm blind. I scheduled an appointment to have it checked out, but it's in a few weeks time. Part of me suspects I'm just anxious about my future but it's really hard to distract myself since most activities involve using my eyes and I'm obsessovely checking if my field of view has gotten worse, or look for macular degeneration symptoms. I'm gonna bring the subject up with my therapist but in the meantime some voices of reason wod be greatly appreciated...",1
"Afraid of hospital infection Well, I do not want to rationalize my fear of hospital infection; however, if we look at the stats, hospital infection rates are significantly higher than before. I will have an arthroscopic knee debridement surgery, the procedure just needs two 4-8 mm incisions basically. Usually, patient would be discharged after a few hours of waking up or stay one night at hospital in some cases. I know in every surgery there is a chance of infection and I know that my surgery is one of the easiest surgeries available too. However, I am really afraid to get an hospital infection. I had 4 surgeries before, but the nearest one was 7 years ago when I was 17 years old. I am almost 5 inches taller(6""4') and 100 pounds heavier now(300lbs currently). I mean when we put all those things together, these make me anxious. To sum up:
I am really scared of hospital infection even though my surgery is pretty easy and incisions will be just 8 mm max.
I am slightly afraid of anesthesia since my body changed a lot in last 7 years.
What are your thoughts? 
Thank you guys!
Have a great sunday! ",1

"I'm afraid to have any tests done so I don't go to the doctor Hi, things aren't going well  


I don't know if this is health anxiety related but I have a problem with having any tests done. Where it's not health anxiety is that I know I don't live a healthy lifestyle. My cholesterol was 230 in 2015. I haven't been tested since. I couldn't deal with a diagnosis. I barely make it day to day with my depression and yet I've already diagnosed myself with type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea, Grave's disease, sometimes bowel OR colon cancer (sometimes I have bloody stool), a permanent heart defect that I'm convinced I have from taking too much immodium (poor man's methadone) back when I was addicted to opiates. I honestly think I'm dying and I'm only 30. But even though I've been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, I am sure I have most of those things because my body is slowly turning itself on me.  


But I think I'd rather die than be diagnosed with anything. I know that sounds insane but I've battled mental health and then later addiction for most of my life. I don't have enough to live for if I have some terrible disease. There would be no real support network. So I don't want a diagnosis if I know I'd rather die than have to deal with it. :-(",1

"Worried about Toxic Shock Because Iâ€™m an irresponsible idiot Thursday I started my period - no big deal there. Friday night my husband and I went out to grab drinks and dinner to celebrate his new job. I had put a tampon in and since it was a light one completely forgot and we had sex.  Neither or us felt the tampon probably due to alcohol. Saturday morning comes and Iâ€™m off running errands. I put a tampon in on top of the one already in there bc I never sleep with a tampon in so It was habit. I changed it normally throughout the day. When I got into bed at 11pm Saturday night I had a weird feeling I left my tampon in from Friday. I go to the bathroom and I had. I removed it, put a pad on and went to sleep. Now Iâ€™m worried sick Iâ€™ve got Toxic Shock Syndrome.

SO yesterday Iâ€™m tired which honestly probably was due to a busy weekend and the fact that I get up at 4 am M-F for work. Last night I was nauseous and dizzy falling asleep. However I had just remembered those were symptoms of TSS then started having them. This morning I felt some nausea and a headache. I get frequent headaches from sleeping like an idiot with my neck, but Iâ€™m worried because itâ€™s together. Logically the nausea is the fact that Iâ€™m presenting to the entire leadership team today at work, but of course I go back to I just have TSS and this is the beginning. Iâ€™m so worried and now Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™ll blow this presentation. I just started a new role so my health insurance doesnâ€™t kick in until April. I would absolutely go to the doctor or ER if I was certain I had TSS and not just bad anxiety. ",1
"Routine eye checkup for first pair of glasses revealed cotton wool spot Or at least, that's what the optometrist said it most likely was. I've been suffering from astigmatism and double vision since I briefly took accutane, and then a week before my followup appointment, my right eye developed a large curved floater in my peripheral vision. It flashes blue in response to bright lights, sometimes it even flashes when I'm laying in bed with my eyes closed. 

I mentioned it at my appointment, got my right eye dilated, and boom... white spot in my nerve layer. Didn't have it on my checkup 12 days prior. He said it was nothing to really worry about, but classified it as most likely being a cotton wool spot, which is usually found in people with hypertension and/or diabetes. Told me it'd most likely work itself out, but to come back in a month. If it's not better by then, off to my doctor for bloodwork. 

Great. I've hardly been able to sleep at all...have therapy today, forgot what time it's at, and I'm obsessing over my eye. I'm not even excited for the glasses anymore. Hopefully this is a freak occurrence and not diabetes or something worse. ",1
"Different Muscle Spasm Sensation While trying to go to sleep last night, I noticed a different type of muscle twitch/spasm in my thigh. I say it's different because any other time I felt a spasm I can see the muscle twitch. It's usually happened in my shoulder/upper arm in past. This one is in my thigh but it feels more like a cellphone vibration that's been coming and going intermittently. I'm a fairly active, muscular guy who's been focusing on running alot. In the past, when I neglect the gym for a few days I've noticed these things happen. I know it's hard to diagnose something like this and I'm most likely overreacting but I've become overly sensitive of new or noticeable indifferences over the years.

"32 female upper back pain and chest pressure Of course delete if this doesnt belong here. As title suggests I've been experiencing upper back pain (between the shoulder blades) and chest pressure with palpitations for about 8 days now. Some fatigue but no other symptoms. Went to ER on Friday, they did urine and blood samples and a chest xray. All clear. Sent me home with a prescription for Tecta and said it was acid reflux. It very well could be of course, but I've struggled with acid reflux a lot in the past and it doesn't feel like this and has never exhibited itself in the form of upper back pain.  Taking pain meds doesn't really relieve the pain and it lasts all day and is worse near the evenings/night. I found taking a hot bath and a massage from my husband can relieve symptoms temporarily (20 mins tops) but it always creeps back. I'm 32 female, 5'1 102lbs, eat relatively well but get little exercise. I am also a long time smoker. Obviously that last point is the most concerning. My GP is generally very dismissive and I don't feel she's going to be much help. Any information at all would be extremely appreciated.",0

"Hit my head on car trunk and caused my health anxiety to soar Im a 22 year old male and I hit my head Saturday afternoon on my car tailgate right before I went to go fish with some friends. It was the very top of my head but more towards my left side. Donâ€™t really think it caused many problems other than hurting because I was still able to fish and remember when it happened and the events after it happened (didnâ€™t blackout or whatever). Later Saturday night I felt my head and realized that it actually got cut and itâ€™s looks kind of like a small raspberry-type injury about the size of a dime maybe smaller.

Anyways this caused me to become a huge hypochondriac and elevated my anxiety as I began to think about brain bleeds and what not. My pupils never became dilated and Iâ€™ve just had a minor headache which could possibly be due to stress/anxiety but the pressure is in my face (eyes and nose area). The place where I hit is still sore and has the common goose-egg. Iâ€™ve got a unrelated doctors appointment Friday and wanted to know if yâ€™all thought I would be fine until then. I also wanted to ease my mind about brain bleeds and how common they were with an injury like mine? Haha hopefully this doesn't make me sound crazy, my anxiety has just been running rampant lately.

I'm so much calmer now I might actually sleep tonight which never happens on bad days.  I hope this can help others. I found this article which explains better than me.

"(TW: mention of suicidal behaviour) anyone with health anxiety who used to suicidal or still is even? A little long, TLDR at end.

I donâ€™t have many people to talk about health anxiety with as I donâ€™t know many people in my real life who deal with it. Or at least who are open about dealing with it.

A few years ago I got diagnosed with Somatic Symptom Anxiety after I went to the hospital with chest pain and difficulty breathing but it turned out to be a result of weeks of severe anxiety and stress building up and manifesting in some physical symptoms which at that point I didnâ€™t even know could happen. I was paired up with a free psychologist from the hospital who dealt with SSA but unfortunately I really didnâ€™t like him and at the time didnâ€™t respect my diagnosis either. I felt discouraged that I had went to the hospital with real symptoms and worry (my dad has a sudden cardiac arrest in his sleep due to a genetic heart condition - they have not found it in me yet - but we still keep a close eye on my heart) so in a way I didnâ€™t feel validated and thought they werenâ€™t understanding me. It took me over a year to finally accept it and realize that I do get very anxious around the thought of loosing health and death.

A few months after all this I started university and was set up with the counsellor there. They turned out to be great and very helpful. Anyway, they really helped me dive into myself and get some better understanding of my anxiety. They also helped me realize something which is why Iâ€™m making this post. 

I had been suicidal for as long as I can remember. Iâ€™m currently 27 but when I was about 7-24 I remember constantly thinking about suicide. I always had a plan. I had attempted it a few times as a teen but wasnâ€™t successful. Luckily I was able to get help and turn my life around and start to actually value life. I still had some times where I thought my life is so hard or this is it or my life is getting so disastrous that I should just end it. Now I find myself valuing life, enjoying being alive, and worrying about death/losing my health. I used to be so at peace with the thought of dying and saw it as an escape. And now it absolutely terrifies me to the point it affects my day to day life. 

I sometimes still have suicidal thoughts that cross my mind but Iâ€™m in a good place in my life and truly believe that I have put it past me for now. Sometimes I worry if something big or tragic happens in my life Iâ€™ll be back to feeling that way but currently Iâ€™m good. 

During the time I was suicidal I never did anything that has caused permanent damage (as far as I can tell so far), but I definitely wasnâ€™t living a healthy lifestyle. Iâ€™ve struggled with addiction and substance abuse that I have recently gotten a hold on but know it could be too late for some damages the substances can do (mostly alcohol) but I am trying my best to live healthily and make sure my body has what it needs to recover. I think this fuels my health anxiety too. 

I will obsess over a symptom and convince myself this is it. Oh youâ€™re finally enjoying life? Well too bad, itâ€™s soon over. 
 
I know mental health and illness is complicated , everyoneâ€™s different, they often intertwine, and more. But Iâ€™m curious to know if anyone else has similar thoughts about this or any really.

Thank you for taking the time to read and consider this.

*TLDR*: Was suicidal as a younger person, seems to be gone now, but since I am enjoying life and feeling guilt about how I used to life I feel it just fuels and fuels my health anxiety. Wondering if anyone has similar experiences to share?",1
"I can't remember a day when I wasn't worried about dying... Hi all:

I'm a 26yo male that's been suffering from health anxiety for pretty much ever it seems. I've run the gauntlet of tests, doctor visits, and scans with my results always coming back negative, yet I'm never satisfied. I always have this sneaking suspicion I'm the 0.1% that is sick and doctors cannot diagnose.

For the past 2.5 years I've had a swollen lymph node ~1cm on the side of my neck, and lower on my neck I can feel multiple squishy, tinier lymph nodes. I've had ultrasounds many times, and even a biopsy for a swollen node in my groin that came back negative for anything strange. Today I found a swelling in my armpit and now I'm in crisis mode once again.

Every day with this feels like a battle; I must constantly convince myself that I'm healthy when deep down, part of me believes I'm not. Every time I think I've made progress it all comes rushing back in like the tide and I'm completely derailed again. I'm so fed up with this and it's clearly no way to live. I never think about the future at all because I can't picture lasting long enough to have a future.

I know this is kind of a rambling wall of text, I just needed to get this out somewhere because everyone I talk to in my personal life just tells me what to do to feel better. To change my thoughts, to eat healthier, to be more active, yet when these thoughts occur it's like I'm completely overwhelmed and I don't feel like I have a choice.

I guess that's it.",1

"How many of you have been triggered by lymph nodes? So I have lived most of my life with anxiety, always taking new faces. On december my uncle died of ALS, and shit was rough, part because he was an amazing uncle and part because that illness is awful.  Ever since then I have been suffering health anxiety and just now I am realizing that's what I am feeling. 




In this time I have been convinced that:



* I have ALS, because fuck yeah I do have all the symptoms. 



* I have a tumor on my head, my long time sinuses problems are caused by it, also as any other new gen kid my sight has develop some wear and my right eye has astigmatism and myopia, which is normal. 



* Last but not least, I have been touching my lymph nodes for fucking 2 months, and they ""don't go away"", which my ENT already said was a normal stuff for me. 




Just now I realized maybe lymph nodes are never that small that if you push hard on your skin they won't be felt, it's said a lymph node with a 1 cm diameter is normal. So I have been probably just pushing real hard on my neck that I always find them ""swollen"".",1
"Hard lump in penis and doctor diagnosed as a cyst with no ultrasound or biopsy I discovered a hard lump in the middle of my penis. It seems pretty deep/internal (like close to the urethra) and not close to the skin. I have no pain and no symptoms, except a minor case of vitiligo (loss of skin pigmentation) on my penis that started developing within the last year. No STDs. I saw my doctor and I feel like he brushed it off too easily. He said it's most likely a cyst, showed me a picture of an epidermoid cyst during his explanation, and said he just wants to monitor it (follow-up in 6 months) and take no further action (no ultrasound, biopsy, etc). My medical record was updated to say it's a cyst.

It's the VA and I don't know what their deal is but I guess they try hard to avoid unnecessary diagnostic procedures. I just don't view it as unnecessary and expected him to order an ultrasound. I pushed back a little said it felt like gambling; the doc responded by saying the odds are against anything serious like penile cancer, I'm too young (31) and further action is unnecessary. On top of that, it's a resident who saw me, who had to confer with an attending for guidance/final approval, and the attending never saw me. The resident seemed inclined to order an ultrasound until he spoke to the attending who put the kibosh on that.

I acknowledge the odds of cancer are low, I just wonder what would happen if they encountered someone who had a genuine case of early-stage penile or urethral cancer. They'd be less likely to catch it at an early stage because they'd wait until it's symptomatic by bleeding, or blocking the urethra, etc. The potential negative consequences for them are nil, and the patient is the one who would be subjected to a penectomy or worse if it turned out they were too complacent. What a nightmare that would be.

Does my irritation seem justified or am I making too big a deal of it?",0

"Health Anxiety flare-up Hey guys. I'm having a miserable time lately. Just some background: I'm a generally healthy 32 year old female. My HA is out of control the last few months. It started in December when I got a (possible?) eczema patch/dry skin on my cheek after a bad cold. I was convinced it was precancerous or the beginning of rosacea. It eventually went away with moisturizing. Didn't stop me from googling the crap out of it, and worrying, and asking my husband to look at it and reassure me. He of course was thrilled with this ðŸ˜œ

Around that time in December, I started to eat a big salad everyday/just upped my veggie intake in general to help lose more weight. This made me gassy, and gave me loose stools. At the beginning of January, I started having some soft, thin stools. This has continued off and on. I have mostly normal stools, but if I go more than once a day, my second is sometimes narrow. This has really scared me, and caused a ton of googling, and symptom checking. 

Yesterday, I noticed a few small streaks of bright red blood on my normal stool toward the end of it. It happened again today with my first bowel movement. I spent pretty much all day yesterday googling, and trying to get a look at what I think is a hemorrhoid. I'm just freaking out. Of course, I'm scared I have cancer. I have an appt with a PCP tomorrow morning re: the blood, which I'm really nervous about. I'm the kind of HA sufferer that hates going to the doctor. 

I also just found out I'm pregnant again (with my third) yesterday, I'm about 4 weeks. I haven't told my husband yet. I'm of course worrying about whatever horrible GI disease I may have, and the impact on this pregnancy.

I started therapy for HA about a month ago. My therapist had told me I need to stop googling and reassurance seeking, but it's so hard, especially with the onset of a scary symptom. Feeling like a failure for googling and symptom checking so much lately. Anyway, I just wanted to share with some people who probably get what I'm going through. ",1
"Nightly chest tightness For the last week and a half I have had uncomfortable chest tightness occurring only at night.

I feel the pressure mainly in the center to right side of my chest. Laying on my back/side seems to give a little relief. My breathing is ok but it feels like I should be having trouble breathing l (if that makes sense?). 

I am able to go to the gym and lift weights with no issues, itâ€™s not until late in the day the tightness shows up.

"I hate this stupid disease. My HA first manifested itself when I was a freshman in college. I felt a coldness in my chest  on the way home for a weekend (probably a flare up of the anxiety I didnâ€™t know I had,  triggered after moving away from home for the first time, dealing with college life and new workload, homesickness, my parents moved from my respective childhood homes, first childhood pet died, etc). 

I googled my symptoms and thatâ€™s where it all went downhill. Heart attack. All of the sudden I was sweating, shaking, chills, feeling of doom, lightheaded, I truly felt I was going to die. To the point I told my mom not to be sad when I inevitably died.


Later that night I had a two hour long panic attack. I begged my boyfriend to drive an hour to where I was to take me to the hospital to which he obliged. I missed my sisterâ€™s college graduation party sitting in the hospital getting laughed at and joked on by the doctors and nursing staff. â€œDid your boyfriend break up with you recently?â€, â€œAre you on your period honey?â€.

Subsequently that semester I went to the emergency room two other times. One doctor gave me an emergency script for Paxil. Never filled it. Never wanted to. 

Went to a cardiologist, my pediatrician, gastroenterologist, got an endoscopy, etc. I even slept at the foot of my dadâ€™s bed for a week because I thought He could save me if I died. turns out Iâ€™m a perfectly healthy 21 year old, which is great until I started searching â€œhealthy 21 year old surprise heart attackâ€ and other similar things. 

The anxiety subsided after about 8 months. A few months later it resurfaced when I convinced myself I had bed bugs in my apartment. Called the bug people 5 times, hired private bug people (instead of my apartment ones), stayed with my mom for a few weeks, begged my best friend to move. No bed bugs. 

Eventually I healed from that two and recently (random itching and a few colds) has convinced me I had lymphoma. A headache recently convinced me I had brain cancer or MS. A bruise on the back of my leg has convinced me I have a deep vein thrombosis for the last three weeks. 


My anxiety has caused me to have a slew of unimaginable PHYSICAL symptoms:
Arm and leg pain
Itchy skin
Chest pain
Tingling 
Numbness 
Panic
Sweating
Shivering
Rashes
Stomach pain 
Twitching muscles
Headaches
Heavy head
Pins and needles
Back pain
Joint pain
Susceptibility to more colds and flus
Mood swings
fatigue 
Lack of appetite
Increased appetite
Missed periods

I hate this terribly debilitating disease. A disease most people will never understand. Convinced my family and friends donâ€™t believe me and donâ€™t trust me and donâ€™t take me seriously, convinced the doctors must be missing something, convinced Iâ€™ll be that rare case that dies at 21 from a heart attack. 

The worst part? Iâ€™ve been doing well, healing. Taking care of myself. It always comes out of no where. Three months of stress, no symptoms. A month later it all catches up to me.

When will I stop being a slave to health anxiety? Checking, poking, prodding, literally self inflicting bruises all over me from constantly pressing on my body parts to check them for changes, pain, sensations.

Please give me your success stories and small  victoriesðŸ˜­

Kidney disease/damage? Freaking out a little right now because I noticed my pee had bubbles in it. Was a bit skeptical but i just decided to flush the toilet but the bubbles came back. Could this be something else or should i go to the doctor to get this checked out?,0
"Hardcore Health Anxiety (lymph nodes, etc) My first health anxiety type was brain tumor. Then it was lung cancer, throat cancer, breast cancer (I am male, 21), testicle cancer, then again lung cancer, again breast cancer. After that it was lung cancer again then once I found out what lymph nodes are, I started to search for them and found multiple. Wow. Couldn't get worse.

Couple months ago I would press hard on my ribs to feel if something hard that I felt is actually a rib or lymph node. I would spend hours rubbing ribs. It caused so much pain.

It's been 3 years since I started to worry about lymph nodes and what gives me a huge relief is a thought ""if it was something cancerous, I would for sure have more symptoms, which I dont"".

I am 21, male, gained 16 kilograms in the past 2 years, went to gym, etc. and I don't think I could do that if I had a terminal illness",1
"Been Working Through â€œRed Herringsâ€ With my Therapist and Itâ€™s Been Helpful for Managing my HA Hi all, I wanted to share my recent success with managing my HA. Iâ€™ve had lifelong depression and have been in therapy for years now. Tried several medications and none have worked for me. 

Though my main problem is depression, every once in a while, I switch to anxiety for a few months, and thatâ€™s when the HA kicks in. Iâ€™m in one of those cycles now.

During my last appointment, my therapist brought up the concept of â€œRed Herrings.â€ Theyâ€™re basically problems that people manifest as a sort of poorly managed coping mechanism for another problem thatâ€™s harder to process. 

The most common example of this is an eating disorder. Very often, the main problem at the core of a person with an eating disorder isnâ€™t their body, itâ€™s the sexual abuse they suffered, or their toxic mother, or the constant pressure they feel put upon them, etc. 

In a way, the red herring can give you something to focus on thatâ€™s easier to process than the more abstract pain that is often the causes of our mental illness. 

For me, weâ€™re exploring the possibility that my HA is a red herring.

My current homework is to practice mindfulness and pinpoint what I have been thinking about when the hypochondria rears its head, and also to let myself experience whatever pain Iâ€™m feeling. 

We often try to avoid or push aside negative feelings like sadness and fear by distracting ourselves with a glass of wine, or binging a tv show, and sometimes you just need that, but sheâ€™s challenged me to try and just let myself experience those negative emotions. Because pain and fear and sadness are parts of life, and while theyâ€™re uncomfortable, theyâ€™re also okay. Itâ€™s OKAY to feel bad sometimes, and letting those feelings have their moment can actually help you. 

So, anyway, sorry for the rant. Iâ€™ve been practicing this for a little while now, and itâ€™s been actually helping me. Anxiety still comes and goes, but itâ€™s much better than it has been.

Iâ€™m not a psychologist, and Iâ€™m not claiming this is a cure for everyone (or even myself), I just wanted to share my recent experience. Maybe someone could get some comfort from it!",1
"Your first panic attack... Think back to the time you experienced or started experiencing your first anxiety induced panic attack(s)-- the shock and debilitation from not knowing or understanding what is going on with you and the lack of control you feel over your own body in trying to identify it to make it better--  If you could go back in time to that first experience, and sit down beside that person, knowing what you know now about your relationship with anxiety, what would you say?

"My story with HA &amp; what has helped me! Hello, hello! Long-time lurker, first time poster. I first came to this sub like most of you, looking for other people who have experienced similar symptoms/reassurance. When I kept searching around, though, and reading people's posts about how they overcame their HA, that actually ended up helping me more than anything else. I've made a lot of progress in the past few months (much of it thanks to advice I've read in this sub!), so I thought I'd share some things that help me and a little bit about my story. 

I first started noticed my anxiety around health in my early 20s. I would take dozens upon dozens of pregnancy tests, convinced that they were all wrong and that I was pregnant anyway (even though I was on birth control at the time). I'd have headaches and get an MRI. etc. etc. You all know how it goes. I would Google myself into a hole until my anxiety was so bad that I started manifesting other physical symptoms. Then I convinced myself that those physical symptoms were also related to whatever I thought was wrong with me in the first place. It was a vicious, endless, painful cycle and I could not get myself out of it. It would go away but sure enough, when my life was stressful, it would happen all over again. 

A few months ago I had a panic attack in a cab on a way to a work meeting because I thought I was having a stroke and it was so bad that I had to get out of the car. I decided right then and there that I had to fix this thing. So, I tried changing some things. 

* I do. not. Google. symptoms. ever. I'm talking EVER. I put a note on my computer to remind me and everything. I do not do it. If I am feeling the urge to do it, I distract myself with a podcast or another task (I am online all day for my job, so if I can do this, anyone can).
* I remind myself that when you Google a symptom, you are asking Google's algorithm to show you the worst case scenario. And that is the result you are always going to get.
* I actually go to my annual doctor's appointments. I used to be so anxious about medical issues that I would avoid check-ups altogether. Now when I am having a minor symptom, I remind myself that I just went to the doctor and my tests/bloodwork were all fine. This helps.
* If a symptom persists for more than a few days, I make an appointment and I go. 99.9% of the time whatever symptom I was wanting to Google disappears within a day. 
* I read this somewhere on here and it really helps. Whenever I'm *not* feeling anxious (or sometimes when I am, if I can focus), I try to sit completely still and really appreciate all the sensations my body is feeling that I usually ignore. It helps to put my other ""symptoms"" in perspective. There are millions of things going on in your body at all times. Obviously sometimes you're going to notice something every now and then. That doesn't mean you're dying. 
* This one is what I struggle with the most but I REALLY try to not scroll through my phone before bed. Putting it on airplane mode and reading a book instead has done literal wonders for my mental health.   


I hope this helps someone! I still struggle with this often, but these tips have really helped me, so I hope they help you too. I'm happy to answer any and all questions anyone might have.",1
"19f low heart rate So I have a lot of anxiety about my heart rate. it has always been about it being too high, I'm always freaking out over high heart rate. never once did it occur to me that it could be too low, because that was never a problem for me. a few weeks ago I was sitting down listening to music with friends. I looked at my fitbit (which I constantly check for accuracy and it is usually a max of 3 beats off) and my heart rate was 54. I got up and I felt super heavy and drained and had zero energy, but I forced myself to walk around and stand up for a while to increase my heart rate. I am diagnosed with Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Disorder. usually when I stand up my heart rate shoots up a fair bit. But I was walking around and standing up and it only went to 56. so I forced myself to skip around. I barely could, I felt super heavy and all I wanted to do was submit to gravity and collapse. that made my heart rate go to 57. it took about half an hour to get to an okay place at 72 bpm sitting down.

then last night, I laid down in bed and my bpm immediately sunk down to 52. I was up for three hours laying in bed bc I couldn't fall asleep over anxiety over my heart rate. I checked it on my fitbit and manually constantly and it was often hovering between 47 and 50. laying in bed typing this now after having stood up for a while it's 59.

i am a 19 year old girl, 120 lbs. during the summer I'm moderately active but during the winter I am pretty darn sedentary. I booked an appt with my cardiologist, but that's for a few days yet. every time I started to fall asleep last night my mind jerked me back, convinced I was either passing out or dying. it's gonna be a anxious and sleepless few days.

"Just gotta say, today was really tough I recently got hired at a fast food restaurant and today was my third day of training. While my trainer was going over some things, I got this pain beneath my shoulder blade that felt really sharp when I breathed in. I started internally panicking, worried something was wrong and I was gonna mess up at my new job, because I didnâ€™t want to leave early or make anyone worry, and I didnâ€™t want to die in the bathroom, etc. I felt a panic attack starting, my chest felt heavy, and I felt so scared, I was convinced something was wrong with my lungs since it was hard to breathe as well. I managed to keep myself from having a panic attack and pushed through my shift, even though I got a bad headache for the last hour of it. I got home exhausted. Iâ€™m still scared that something is wrong with my lungs. Health anxiety is so incredibly exhausting. I hate waking up every day worrying about dying. Itâ€™s so hard just to work at this minimum wage job. Itâ€™s just really tiring. I feel like crying.",1
"Lumps and bumps I just need somewhere to let this out. I have a skin disorder called hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). Itâ€™s pretty mild for HS, and the last few years itâ€™s gotten much better. 

I have also noticed a couple of cysts. On the back of my head, my ankle, and on the batwing area of my arm. 

Doctors have looked at the cysts and told me theyâ€™re nothing to worry about, but I canâ€™t stop worrying that itâ€™s something else or that having these cysts means Iâ€™m developing others in dangerous spots- my brain or lungs. 

I stupidly looked up diseases that are cooccurring with hs- thinking it would make me feel better if I saw that people with HS are just more likely to develop some benign cysts- and it mentioned thyroid disorder (which I have) and lymphoma and heart disease (which I am constantly terrified about).

Talk me down. Anyone else have stuff like this?",1
"Worried about possible Petechiae So for the past few weeks Iâ€™ve been having these tiny, pinprick-sized red or sometimes brown dots appear on my skin. Of course the anxious side of my brain has decided that Iâ€™m dying of leukemia or some other cancer, even though I have no other symptoms that point towards it. 

Whatâ€™s especially odd is that these spots appear in certain areas and then go away after a few days. The first time they appeared was on my right hand and arm after I spent the night with my girlfriend. After about two days they went away. Now thereâ€™s some of these little spots on my right foot and ankle, and seemingly nowhere else on my body. Anyone else have something like this occur? Iâ€™ll probably see my doctor in a few days and see what she thinks, but until then that anxious part of me is absolutely certain that Iâ€™m a dead man walking.",1

Esophagus cancer was mentioned on the news last week and it has been on my mind since. Some of the symptoms I have had for a while.

regurgitating food , chest pains, difficulty swallowing and in the last week it now feels like food is stuck down there, a lump in my throat feeling as well as further down.

"Fear of Neurological disease because I suck at balancing on one leg with my eyes closed. Ok so I was reading online about the Rombergs test, where you stand with your two feet together and fold your arms then close your eyes. You are supposed to be able to do this for at least 20 seconds. I can do this fine.

Then the Sharpened Rombergs test. 
Stand with your heel to the big toe of the opposite foot (heel to toe) put your hands on your hips and close your eyes. You are supposed to be able to do this for 21-31 seconds. Sometimes I can do like 1.5 minutes, other times I can only do like 15 seconds. 

Then the big one. Standing on one leg with your eyes closed for 15-30 seconds. Stand on your good foot, lift the other foot while bending it, has to be at least 6 inches off the ground. 

I CANT DO IT. I struggle to get to 10 seconds. Sometimes I get 30 but thatâ€™s after like 4 tries.

"Does anyone have HA about others, but not themselves Hey guys, I'm 21 years old and have had crippling anxiety and stress about my girlfriend for about the last year or so.

"My hypochondria has returned severely after a night of heavy drinking I basically remember having episodes of debilitating hypochondria since I was 16 all the way up to recently. Now I'm 23 and I have had a relatively health anxiety free year. Four nights ago I went out drinking with my friends and we all had a terrible experience, blacked out, awful hangovers with a whole lot of symptoms and it's brought back my hypochondria full force. 

Now I'm worrying about stupid things again like whether or not I inhaled too much of the spray cleaner I used because it'll give me lung cancer, or how I'm so anxious it'll give me heart problems, maybe a clot or a stroke, also is the food I eat tainted with some carcinogen, am I being poisoned by my environment, etc etc it's never ending. 

I am for the most part physically ok, some slight headache and nausea but so much better since that first day post drinking. Yet my mental state is now a mess.

"Convinced I have MS Hey. I can't seem to calm myself down right now... I've completely convinced myself I have MS.. my HA has been seriously terrible lately. I keep having panic attacks and I have embarrassingly broken down several times this past week at work. This post is long, I'm very sorry.

I'm a 21 yo female. I've had health anxiety for nearly all my life. For the past few months I've had pain through my left buttock and leg. Went to Dr who said it was pinched sciatic nerve which completely makes sense (my dad has also had the same problem and it sounds exactly like what I have) anyway I still obsessed over it being a blood clot or something serious. Sometimes when I am very stressed, my arms tend to go weak and I shake. I also will feel numb in certain areas of my body. Recently though,  the area around the left side of my mouth has felt weak/numb when I'm anxious. I always check in the mirror and it's not drooping or anything. It makes my anxiety go through the roof. I also am very aware of my speaking when this happens and I sometimes feel as if I slur my words. It never lasts very long and usually if I take anxiety medication it goes away fairly quick. However when googling this (I know, I can't keep googling things) like the first result is MS.. I can't shake it... Here are my other symptoms...

-very tired. I did just start on two anxiety medications so I'm trying to attribute my tiredness to that.
-I'm constantly tense. My jaw is nearly always tight and my shoulders are always up to my ears.
-tight chest/feels like I'm short of breath frequently. I think I'm like.. slightly hyperventilating at all times.
-frequent nausea. 
-blurry vision especially at night or after looking at my phone for a long time (having it now unfortunately)
-feeling disconnected
-dizzy when I'm extremely anxious
-i get very itchy on my thighs and on my arms. This has happened all my life. Usually if I'm wearing warm clothes, under a blanket, or I've just taken a hot shower (I've always had this and assumed dry skin but I learned that sometimes MS can cause hot itchiness that is often mirrored on the body) even worse, I noticed yesterday that in the places I've scratched really hard, I've even left small bruises and a few scratches.
-for as long as I can remember, I've had this thing where if I'm laughing really hard I lose my grip (can't hold a pencil or something) idk it's weird
-when I'm anxious (sometimes when I'm not) my hands shake
-ive always been pretty strong but for as long as I can remember, my arms shake like if I'm pouring a pitcher of water or something.
-i have also had excema on my hands for the last few years (Dr said due to stress and excessive hand washing which lines up) but it did start out mirrored
-I watched a video yesterday of a man who had been hardcore dealing with MS fears who went to the doctor and he was fine and all. He listed a few of his symptoms, a lot of which I shared. He also mentioned very weak muscles and twitching along with pins and needles in his limbs. I was thankful I hadn't really had any of that. But seriously just a few hours later, all these symptoms hit. Even worse today. My hands have been jittery the whole time I've typed this..

 I know there are more symptoms. I'm sorry, this post is a mess. I'm seriously so scared. Lately all I can think about is my health. I'm finding it hard to do basic tasks and function normally. I'm sorry that this was so long. I just wondered if anyone else deals with this.",1

"Irrational fear of rabies So I know that my fear is irrational but I canâ€™t stop thinking about it! 

At the beginning of January (I mean very beginning like 4th) I was at a store where the owner had two cats. The cat that bit was very friendly at first, was rubbing against my mom and I. My mom had playfully ruffled its head and it had swatted at her, I then went to pet it and it bit me! Looking back it the incident I know the cat was most likely just annoyed hence why it bit me. 

At the end of January I (mistakenly) decided to consult dr google about rabies. This seemed to set something off in my brain, that night I couldnâ€™t sleep. I was terrified that I was going to die of rabies. I went to the doctors and received a tetanus shot and was told to call the owner. 

My mom called for me and the owner told her that since the cats are in a public place they have to be up to date on their shots. While this was reassuring at first, a day later I kept having what ifâ€™ thoughts. Such as â€œwhat if the lady was lying about about the cat being vaccinatedâ€

Either way itâ€™s now March and Iâ€™m experiencing what I think is anxiety. Every time I think about my health, my chest tightens up and it feels like I canâ€™t breath. Iâ€™m having awful muscle twitches in my legs, arms, and eyelids. Iâ€™m also having what I think is â€œpainsâ€ in my left arm (not the arm I was bit by the cat).

Even now I canâ€™t help but wonder â€œwhat if Iâ€™m just having a long term incubation periodâ€

Havenâ€™t vomited any blood (red color is from foods I have eaten). Diarrhea usually precedes the vomiting, and has a certain smell (smell only occurs in diarrhea RIGHT before I puke). Immediately after puking the nausea goes away until the next episode. Symptoms worsen before exams, presentations, stressful events. Ulcer has been ruled out.

I keep getting headaches one on side of my head, sort of around my left temple. I get short bursts of pain a few times a day and itâ€™s been going on for over a week now. I think I drink enough water but Iâ€™ve been getting up earlier lately so am probably getting less sleep than usual.

"Red bump on perinium between scrotum and anus. (NSFW) I've had this sole, red bump on my perineum (between anus and scrotum) for at least a year or two now.  It is less than half a centimeter wide.  It is elevated and has loose, red skin hanging off it that can be ""flapped"" around. It was always painless, and I thought it was a skin tag, but it has recently begun to hurt slightly.  It has never changed size as far as I can tell.  

I am 30 years old and male.

I am not sexually active, and haven't had intercourse in 5 years.

I need help :( vertigo I donâ€™t know what to do. Ever since the end of January this year I have been feeling totally off balance and at times dizzy like Iâ€™m going to throw up. It feels as though Iâ€™m on a boat thatâ€™s rocking and that the floor is uneven. Itâ€™s especially worse when I sit down or am lying down as it feels like someone is rocking me back and forth. Iâ€™ve been to the hospital where they said I had vertigo but gave me medication that didnâ€™t help. Iâ€™ve been to the doctor who looked at me eyes and everything and said it was vertigo. I went to a naturopath who said he wasnâ€™t sure what it was but it could be an effect of the 20 mg of cirpalex that Iâ€™m taking. Iâ€™m seeing a physical therapist who doesnâ€™t think the vertigo is coming from my ear canal but rather stress and neck tension. The rocking has been so bad recently and it hasnâ€™t stopped at all. I want to get an MRI and I genuinely believe I have a brain tumor. Please help Iâ€™m terrified and donâ€™t know what to do ,1
"Just a share I've been browsing here quietly for a good while and wanted to post just to share my HA experiences.

I'm 29 - turning 30 at the end of the month - and have suffered from Health Anxiety for about 5 years now. My mom died from alcoholism when I was 16 so I think that is probably my gateway. In the last 5 years, I've had C. Diff from antibiotics, been diagnosed as hypothyroid (severely high untreated TSH after a pregnancy really caused some complications), had emergency surgery after gallstone induced pancreatitis (though I had pancreatitis and liver blockages multiple times throughout a year and a half and during a pregnancy which weren't ever caught because I lived so close and got to the ER too soon for anything to reflect in my lipase and liver tests) and now have tachycardia that may be P.O.T.S but am in the process of cardiologist appointments to nail down the issue. I'm also possibly bipolar after having been prescribed Paxil and it putting me into mania, though I stopped seeing my psychiatrist before he made a definitive diagnosis. Scared of getting the diagnosis and then everything I experience from here on out being blamed on bipolar like doctors do now with my thyroid.

My HA is ruining my life. I spend hours Googling because I feel like I can't trust doctors after so many run-ins with them where they said pancreatitis was gastritis and sent me on my way assuming I was some kind of drug-seeker. Because of my Paxil experiences, I'm afraid to try any kind additional head med. I'm a mess, essentially, like many here.

Currently obsessing over the fact I've never had my cholesterol checked and every time I eat or drink anything other than water, I get fatigued to such a point that it feels like I'm drugged. Husband is diabetic so I've been able to check my sugar levels and there's nothing unordinary there. I check my blood pressure regularly as well. The overwhelming, sedating-like fatigue also comes with even minimal activity, which has also had me freaked out about heart failure. (All my ekgs have been fine, though I'm not even sure that rules out heart failure.) I've had iron tests, hormone tests (though I still suspect hormones to be the underlying culprit), am taking vitamin d for a deficiency, thyroid hormone and T4 is in range... everything is ""normal"". I was vegan for 6+ months, quit smoking several years ago and very rarely drink. I tested positive twice for ANA and one of the SS-A or SS-B tests for Sjogren's Autoimmune but my doctor still insists I don't have it, though another doctor at my clinic says I do because that's all you need... not sure how that works. Anyway, Sjogren's may also be a culprit in my ""potential reasons you're dying"" book.

Does anyone here have suggestions as to what helps them overcome their hypervigilance and keep themselves distracted from terrorizing themselves? I am in desperate need.

Also, if you have any mental illnesses that your HA piggyback's on, I'd like to hear your experience, too.

"Feta cheese with bonus mould Ok so My mom gave me an entire brined brick of feta cheese because no one else in the family likes feta i guess.  I've had it about two weeks now?

So I nibbled on some with some crackers, but now I'm kinda worried?  I googled it but nothing actually specified my specific case.  The closest case I could find had a lot more mould involved.  Is this okay to eat?  If not, are the crackers leaning against it ok?  I paid 2.47 for these crackers and I have like a third of the box on this plate.

"Brain Tumor Concerns Iâ€™ve been feeling super anxious lately and thought it would be worth venting out at the moment. Iâ€™m M/20 years old, and Iâ€™ve been feeling anxious over the idea of a brain tumor.

- Headaches have been present-ish, but theyâ€™ve been minor. I wouldnâ€™t call them the worst headaches in my life.
- I feel like Iâ€™ve been seeing tiny streaks of light? Itâ€™s not huge glares, or anything that has messed up my vision, but I feel like I see tiny streaks sometimes. 
- I sometimes feel like I have double vision when reading? But that might be just a me problem since I need glasses.
- Left eyelid has a small twitch. Though the right eyelid has been starting a bit too.
- Been waking up earlier than normal.
- Not sure if my speech always had me stuttering. Might be overthinking it.
- My ears have been ringing for a while now. 
- I havenâ€™t vomited, or suffered any seizures yet.

I dunno if I can chalk this up to allergies, since they hit hard this season. I just need comfort that this isnâ€™t a reason to panic. This anxiety has been really messing me up, and even if Iâ€™m going to the doctor in two weeks, Iâ€™m a bit concerned for my health.",1

"Vision oddities Hey all, just wanted to ask if anyone had any similar experiences to myself. A few months ago, I (25) had my first panic attack that sent me to the ER. EKG came out perfect, sent me home. Soon after, I started getting more and more panic and anxiety symptoms at an increasing rate. Started diagnosing myself foolishly with all kinds of different things from heart problems, a ministroke, MS, brain tumor, the works. Went from 0 to hypochondriac in weeks. Went to my doctor and got some tests for thyroid and such, all fine. My BP is slightly high at 135/82 as well.

Most of the symptoms of everything has gone away, except my vision. I woke up one morning about 6-7 days ago with.. not what I would call ""blurry"" vision, but almost an otherworldly filter applied to it. Nothing is any more difficult to read, no flashing, no pain, no color changes, but things are just hard to *look at* and I've got a bit of tunnel vision going on. I've always had floaters in my vision and there aren't any new ones, but the floaters themselves are kinda blurry now and I notice them everywhere instead of just outside.

Could it just be eye strain from being in a constant state of stress for a month straight with poor sleep quality? I'm not asking for a diagnosis obviously, but I want to know if this is a shared experience from anyone else.",1
"Shortness of breath that just wonâ€™t go away Age: 19
Male
220lbs



Just for some context, Iâ€™ve been feeling this constantly since December, and since October Iâ€™d say Iâ€™ve had pretty bad health anxiety after finding multiple lumps under my skin. In November I went to a dermatologist to get them all checked out and the dermatologist said they were all lipomas and nothing to worry about, but health anxiety forgets about that after a week and ever since then Iâ€™ve been scared of the potential of those lumps being sarcoma cancer. Iâ€™m not sure if this is what is causing my shortness of breath, as the shortness of breath never goes away, itâ€™s there 24/7. Yesterday I went to a walk in clinic to get examined for my shortness of breath and the doctor noticed a slight wheeze which sent me into a spiral of health anxiety as, me thinking I have sarcoma, I thought it mightâ€™ve spread to the lungs or something. Anyways he does some tests to see the power of my exhale (donâ€™t remember what itâ€™s called) and then gives me abeuterol and tries the text again. I got the same results, but he said when he checked my breathing after the wheeze was gone. So, in short, is this shortness of breath from anxiety, or could it be a very minor case of asthma? The doctor also got a chest X-ray done and said everything looked normal.

Then a week goes by, my right hand and foot start having a burning sensation and of course look up online on what causes that and now I think I have diabetes or that I have nerve damage from exercising. itâ€™s been like this for 4 days and I still have the burning sensations but they come and go and Iâ€™m anxious about it.",1
"Positive thinking for others whose HA is cancer based (the what ifs) So my health anxiety is almost entirely grounded in cancer. Today Iâ€™m worried about lymphoma and brain cancer. A month ago it was lung and digestive cancer(s). Before that leukemia and before that bone cancer. You get the gist. 

My dad was diagnosed with cancer and did pass away from it. Before you freak out, he was older, active but poor poor diet his whole life. History of alcoholism. I mention this because itâ€™s good context for my issues. My health anxiety spirals every year around this time (Jan-Mar) when he was sick. 

Even though I know many many statistics, about age of diagnosis and general health and this and that, it doesnâ€™t always stop the worrying, as many of you are well aware. 

I tend to catastrophise. If I feel bad, it must be cancer, and since itâ€™s cancer, Iâ€™ll die a painful death in a couple months. 

I typically avoid cancer stories as they trigger me up pretty badly (duh) but today I stumbled across a story of a 27 year old guy who was diagnosed with a rare brain cancer a few months ago. Today he announced he was cancer-free. 

The world isnâ€™t perfect, and it isnâ€™t always fair. There are lots of what ifs. But I think itâ€™s so so so important to remember the what ifs are conjecture and NOT fact. 

So you go through the thing, your lymph nodes are swollen. Youâ€™re probably a little sick with a cold, or maybe youâ€™ve been poking your neck non stop for weeks to check. So you probably donâ€™t have lymphoma. Okay, but what if you do? Honestly, youâ€™d probably be fine. This is not ALWAYS the case. But if we go by percentages, 99% of your worries are not cancer, or malignant, or serious at all. 75% of that 1% of real and serious conditions respond well to treatment. Thereâ€™s variance but this is a great time in history to have cancer. Treatments are so plentiful and effective. Maybe you DO have brain cancer, but so? That 27 year old kid did. Heâ€™s alive and well. 

To be abundantly clear, I think itâ€™s most important to challenge false conclusions, first and foremost. Challenge your worries. If youâ€™re in a rut though, and you just canâ€™t shake the feeling that â€œTHIS TIME is has to be cancer, I just know it has to beâ€: stay optimistic! We are a community of worriers. Challenge yourself to think of best case scenarios, even if theyâ€™re within the worst case. 

Iâ€™m here with you, if youâ€™re scared of something today. And Iâ€™m so positive that we will get through it just fine, I want you to be positive of that as well :)",1
"I've been worrying about aneurysms since last night and its been a really rough time. How do I get past this? Hey everyone, I'm so glad that subreddit exists because it's so comforting to know that I'm not the only one who struggles with this type of anxiety (since I was a little girl).

Recently though, I have been really sick - like since before Thanksgiving. I've had bronchitis, the Norovirus (ended up in hospital), tonsillitis, the flu, then the stomach flu again, and now I'm at home sick for a week because the cold I've had since early November never went away and it has turned into walking pneumonia and strep throat. My throat is covered in huge white blisters and it's just so disgusting.

But anyways, I was put on a really high antibiotic and Prednisone 3x a day, and it's just made me feel anxious and so strange. I started feeling like my pulse in my groin and it really freaked me out, so I Googled (I want to punch myself lol) and the first thing that came up was aneurysm. Then my husband told me it was probably the steroid making my nerves jittery, so I googled again (I rly need to stop) and it said that some people have experienced something called ""phantom vibrations"" or something like that. The thing is though, I'm pretty sure this has happened to me before and I've never paid it any attention.

I had a rly bad panic attack right after that, but I took a shower and calmed down and was fine. But today, my hip and leg have been aching, and I'm not sure if it's my fibromyalgia acting up bc I'm sick or if it's just a psychosomatic symptom or even possibly the Prednisone  making me feel this way.

Has anyone else ever experienced this? Because I know it's probably nothing, but I've just had a rough time today with being worried about it And having the thought of aneurysm in the back of my brain.

I have final exams next week and Iâ€™ve been very stressed out lately, and although most people tend to overeat when theyâ€™re stressed, I am the type of person who feels nauseous and does not like the thought of food during stress. 

Anyways, this past week or so I was sick with a sore throat and developed a sore neck that still keeps reappearing. On top of that, today my left leg started hurting in a specific spot and Iâ€™m pretty sure something happened to my muscle. My anxiety has been elevated because after a night out over the weekend, my friend took pictures and although all our eyes had a white reflection from the flash, one of my eyes was especially white in multiple pictures. I have read about concerning disorders that can be a cause to the white flash, so I immediately went into panic mode. I have been experiencing problems with this eye and suspicions of glaucoma by one doctor, and overall my eye has been especially red lately. I canâ€™t help but think something is seriously wrong but I keep reassuring myself that itâ€™s probably just because Iâ€™m a heavy contact lens wearer and my eyes need some oxygen and relaxation. I made an appointment with my eye doc to make sure. In the meantime, Iâ€™m trying my best to calm down and forget everything so I can study and not jeopardize my future. :) ",1

There's so many different types of illnesses to consider and be at risk of. It drives me insane. ,1
"Iâ€™m convinced I have a urethral stricture In may of last year I had a type of explosion in my bladder. It came with an insane feeling of urgency, frequency and a feeling that my
Bladder was in the grip of a vice. I also had an electrical type feeling in my bladder and Perineum.

I saw a urologist who thought I had a urethral stricture. I was sent for a cystoscopy that showed everything was ok. That was in September 2018. 3 months later the urgency and frequency decreased but then what accompanied was pelvic pain, tailbone pain, I had to start sitting down to urinate and I had to start milking my urethra to empty it - at this time I was also tapering from 6mgs of clonazepam. I hit 2mgs when this started. I finished my taper on clonazepam in the middle of February.

I now have all of those symptoms but theyâ€™re at full force now. For the past two weeks I had a slight burn at the end of urination. Peeing didnâ€™t hurt but at the end I had a sharp/burn pain in a specific area in the top of my penis/urethra. 

For the past two weeks Iâ€™ve had a feeling that thereâ€™s a marble stuck in my urethra. Sometimes I can feel pressure in my urethra when I move about. Sometimes I get a sharp stabbing pain down my urethra too. The side of my penis hurts too.  I
Also have to gently milk my urethra to get the rest of the urine out. 

My fear is that the cystoscopy has caused a stricture. Itâ€™s done the very thing that it was supposed to rule out. There was no blood after it was done, nor did it burn when I peed, but the tip of my penis was very swollen for an
Hour or so. Apparently itâ€™s extremely rare for someone to get a stricture from a routine cystoscopy, especially in the area I think mine is. But Iâ€™m 100% convinced that I have one. Itâ€™s making me very ill. 

I see the urologist in 5 days time. Iâ€™m in a chronic pelvic pain support group and apparently this is a very common symptom. But other guys have the same symptoms and have a stricture. 

I donâ€™t want another cystoscopy but Iâ€™m guessing Iâ€™ll have to have one as itâ€™s the only way to treat a stricture. I canâ€™t believe Iâ€™m in this mess. Iâ€™m so upset and frustrated. ",1

Heart anxeity Iâ€™ve had a bad month so far. I was put into a psychiatric ward for a while against my will and now that Iâ€™m out I have to go to court ordered group counseling. Anyway my anxiety problems basically all surround my heart. Even now I have chest tightness and a horrible pain in my left arm. I canâ€™t convince myself itâ€™s not a heart attack no matter how hard I try. Iâ€™ve been to 3 cardiologists and been to the er at least 20 times and had ekgs every time. Had a stress test and an echo and it all came back negative. I canâ€™t stop convincing myself that something has happened since then and Iâ€™d go back to the er but Iâ€™m afraid of being admitted again. Iâ€™m a 20 year old male and have my whole life ahead of me but Iâ€™m to paralyzed by fear to live it. I â€œknowâ€ Iâ€™m having a heart attack every time it happens and itâ€™s hard to even imagine it getting better and being happy. I was on Klonopin and it seemed to help but they took me off cold turkey in the hospital and put me on all new meds. Iâ€™m just scared. If anyone has any advice Iâ€™d really appreciate it. ,1
"Shoulderâ€™s going crazy. Hi.

My very first post here, but been reading it for a long time and have a quick question.

Lately, Iâ€™ve been dealing with a lot of your common symptoms, such as: headache, nausea, stomachache, shortness of breath, heart palpitations, numbness, random quick pains all over, etc..

But yesterday night I was laying in my bed and suddenly, completely out of blue, my left shoulder started to hurt. And it is very painful when touched. I can move my arm completely and itâ€™s not painful. But when pressed or even just touched gently, it hurts. I havenâ€™t injured it anywhere as I usually spend my days on my laptop working while layind down. And of course I started googling, constantly think about the pain and touch it every 5mins to make sure if the pain is still there. And now it feels like my arm is not painful, but has a weird sensation.

Also, read somewhere that anxiety can cause these random bone, muscle or joint pains all over the body. So was wondering if anyone else had this kind of pain or am I going insane?

Thank you and have a lovely day!",1
"A small victory I don't post very often and never before on this sub but I wanted to share a small victory.  As you can imagine I spend a lot of money on doctor visits and tests that turn out to be just fine. I have spent too darn much and so I've challenged myself to just wait things out no matter what. My first challenge arrived quickly.  

On Tuesday I got a rash very likely from sweating/rubbing because I noticed it right after the gym and it was around my neck and chest where my shirt collar rests. It was red, itchy and painful.  I DID NOT Google.  I started to,  but I stopped.  I put some hydrocortisone cream on it and ignored it. Ever so briefly thought about going to urgent care (autoimmune? My joints hurt... is it infected? Etc.) 

It's almost gone today. Four days. Granted the source of the rash was clear. And I'm still worried about the size of the lymph nodes in my neck. And random belly pains make me think of tumors.... but this one thing..... I waited out this rash and it was fine. It gives me strength to ""ignore"" the next thing.",1

"Last month filled with illness and anxiety, not being able to sleep well, and surgery possibly coming up. Need advice on how to cope. I've had really bad panic attacks and anxiety since I was around 14, up till the age of 16. After my first major panic attack, I was hospitalized for a week, after which they concluded it was anxiety and referred me to a psychiatrist. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've essentially been free of panic attacks since, but have had periods of anxiety, centered around my health. 

&amp;#x200B;

The last month has been especially terrible. It started with an eye infection that caused an eye edema, where my left eyeball developed a dent and a bump. The ambulance ride was nerve-wracking, and I was given antibiotics at the ER and then discharged.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, I got stomach flu. Terrible week. I felt weak, dehydrated, and completely sapped of all energy. More antibiotics, I felt better after a few days. This is when I started to become hyper-aware of my heartbeat. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then, I got sick again for 2-3 days: fever, cold, sore throat. Had some relief, but then went out on the weekend, walked home in skimpy clothes in freezing cold and rain, bronchitis for another week. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last week, I started getting wisdom tooth pain. It's an infection and abscess. Dentist said I need to have it pulled. Terrified of the surgery, and especially the anesthesia. Haven't had it before, scared of an allergic reaction or complications. Dental anesthesia can briefly cause palpitations, which sucks because I'm so worried over the health of my heart. 

&amp;#x200B;

Around 4 weeks of constant health-related drama, worrying, palpitations, panic. The worst is probably the poor sleep. I cant fall asleep easily because I keep checking my heart rate and freak out when it slows down. My resting heart rate is around 60, so I really freak out when there's a long time between beats. This leads to palpitations, poor breathing patterns, tingling, twitching, you name it. 

&amp;#x200B;

tldr; four weeks of infections, anxiety + panic, worrying about my heartbeat and shit sleep, possibly getting wisdom tooth surgery, terrified of anesthesia and related complications. I'm tired and need advice on how to cope.",1
"How to go about requesting a heart check up? Hi everyone, I guess Iâ€™ve always been a little bit of a hypochondriac, but serious health anxiety is a new thing for me. I was required recently to take a 9 hour long first aid certification class for a new job, in which we discussed heart attacks and cardiac arrest for hours on end. Following that, Iâ€™ve been seeing deaths of young people around my age such a Lotte Van Der (19) and Felicite Tomlinson (18). I am 21, and now Iâ€™m in constant fear of an underlying heart issue that I am unaware of. I would like to get whatever tests are necessary to easy up some of my anxiety, because I know that I have never had any tests done regarding my heart. So my question is how do I go about this? What do I request? My mom suggested I say that there is a history of heart attacks in my family, but Iâ€™m not sure if thatâ€™s necessary. At 21, am I going to receive a lot of push back regarding the necessity of these tests or is it pretty straight forward to get? Any advice would be great, thank you so much. ",1

Iâ€™m not sure why Iâ€™m so worried about it, but for the last two weeks Iâ€™ve been SUPER worried about having HIV. Two weeks ago I found a cyst behind my ear and went to the doctors thinking it was a swollen lymph node. He told me it was a cyst and sent me home with a cream, itâ€™s basically gone by now.

But Iâ€™m still convinced I have HIV. I know the best solution is to get tested, but I work so much that I wonâ€™t be able to make that happen until next week.

Iâ€™ve had allergies and eczema my entire life, so while the seasons are changing here, theyâ€™ve been going crazy. Now I have a swollen lymph node in my neck.

Iâ€™ve never had any of the symptoms of HIV (flu like symptoms lasting weeks, a rash, vomiting &amp; diarrhea, etc.) But something in my brain is just TELLING me I have it. 

Iâ€™m a gay man and for the last few years Iâ€™ve been really safe with sex. My main fear is two people I slept with back in 2013. One of those guys was tested in 2017 (when I was seeing him again) and he came back clean. Ive slept with a total of one other person in the last two years because we were dating for the majority of it and he was clean as well. But I am still convincing myself I have it.

Afterwards the burning was barely noticeable but I know it was still there. Saturday morning I wake up and itâ€™s still barely noticeable but still there so I make a doctors appointment. Unfortunately, my regular doctor isnâ€™t in that day and neither is my usual back up so I book with the only doctor thatâ€™s in. At this clinic for as long as I could remember (Iâ€™ve gone here for over 10 years) they usually give you the results of the urine sample before you leave, keep this in mind that was the only reason I went because I convinced myself the only thing this could be is a uti or perhaps something worse even though I know I donâ€™t have any of the symptoms but you never no right? Itâ€™s better to be safe. Anyways, she comes in and I explain my problem. At first she mentions it could just be irritation and she mentions something in particular that I do to dry my nether regions and I thought wow I could of actually cut myself or overwashed and a wave of relief washed over me. Because I do tend to overwash and use scented products. But then she said she would prescribe me a medication if I have a uti. She left and the nurse came in a few minutes later. The whole thing took 5 mins. 

The nurse comes back in saying I wonâ€™t have the result for three days and Iâ€™m confused so I call in the doctor. And she said thereâ€™s no harm in taking it even if you donâ€™t have it. This goes against what my usual doctor says, she never suggests taking anything unnecessarily. 
Especially when it comes to a urine culture. Because of resistant bacteria or something. 
Anyways i left and picked up the medicine but it occurred to me she didnâ€™t ask many questions...so that left me thinking it could be something else. Like a cut or a yeast infection or just being incredibly over washed. She didnâ€™t even ask if I was sexually active or not or if I was having any other symptoms or if my period is due. 
But I was also in shock by how impersonal that visit felt as itâ€™s not what Iâ€™m used to. 
So I have the medication but you know, me being anxious I donâ€™t want to take it unless I have the results of the culture. At some moments it feels like Iâ€™m just irritated down there given what happened during the week leading up to these events. I quit using the regular soap I was using down there but I stilll used it for the rest of my body and if some slips down there it does burn. 

But sometimes I think omg did I just had a tiny muscle pain in my back is it an infection. Or regular body sensations freak me out. Iâ€™m really trying to relax but my mind keeps racing to all sorts of things :/ ",1

Iâ€™m 27F, very fit, never smoked, had the radon tested in my house last fall, it wasnâ€™t optimal but was well within safe range, never been exposed to asbestos that i know of, no family history of cancer. About a month ago I started having upper respiratory symptoms, first shortness of breath and chest tightness that led to a cough. then i started having heart palpitations so i went to my PCP. she did an EKG which was normal and listened to my lungs and said they sounded clear. My cough cleared up after a couple days and I started getting back to normal but my anxiety was still nagging at me.

About a week after my doctorâ€™s visit, I woke up from a nap totally unable to breathe and my blood pressure was very high so I went to the urgent care. they ran the full gambit of tests on me which all came back fine - EKG, blood work, chest x-ray, all normal. The doc said my lungs sounded clear. Figured it was a panic attack.

I felt okay for a day or two but my heart palpitations persisted and I still felt short of breath. I emailed my doctor and she ordered a bunch more blood tests which have all come back normal except for my blood calcium which was .2 above range.

&amp;#x200B;

I found this subreddit when researching health anxiety. My long term partner has been afflicted by this for the last 3 months. I know that is not a very long time, but it's been very hard. It feels like he suddenly starting having heart problems and ended up in the ER because he called an ambulance. They said it was panic/anxiety, and things have gotten worse since. We have done all the medical tests, and physically the doctors say he is fine and that his symptoms are anxiety. He is convinced otherwise, but I see his behaviors mirrored in all of the posts here. I believe he has health anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really trying to be as helpful as I can, but I feel so helpless. I am trying to reassure him that he is okay, but every other day he spirals into believing that he has cancer/kidney disease/muscular disorders/liver cirrhosis, etc etc. He even at one point thought he had an STD, which was hurtful to me as his long-term partner because I have not been unfaithful and I viewed it as an attack on my character. I realize now that it is US against THE ANXIETY but sometime's it's still hard. Before all of this, we used to go and do things all the time. Now it feels like we don't go out and any time I can get him out, it's a chore because he feels so sick (or anxious).

&amp;#x200B;

He has started therapy, but insists it will not help because he thinks he has a true medical problem and not health anxiety. I want to be as supportive as I can be, but I'm really struggling with how to support without enabling or indulging in his fears. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm hopeful that this community can help give me some advice on how to help a partner experiencing health anxiety? What is helpful for you to hear from your partners? How can I be the most supportive partner I can be without losing myself (which is how I am starting to feel lately)? Should I push or encourage him to go out even when he says he is sick? I miss our old life, but I don't want to force him into an activity if he really is ill. Alternatively, is there anything I can do to be more empathetic? What do you wish your partner knew about your health anxiety?

Everything started in November about 4 months ago, on vacation in Vietnam. I experienced what I think was my first panic attack with heart palpitations, pressure on chest, difficulty to breath etc. Since then, I have experienced so many different symptoms and sensations such as lump in throat, feeling of not getting enough air, difficulty to breath, waking up several times every night (sometimes with a strange feeling of fear), lately my skin feels like its burning or is sensitive, it also sometimes feels like my heart flutters, skips a beat or is just pounding out of my chest but not a fast heartbeat just very hard and powerful. I also experience headaches like never before, extremely cold feet pretty much all the time. Man, I've probably missed a few sensations too but this is really getting to me.

It doesn't seem to get worse with exertion either, as I run and do other cardio and weights at least 4 times a week. It just comes and goes seemingly at random.

I want to believe it's nothing wrong and it's a nerve thing at worse. My mind won't let me. To it, any arm pain like this is impending doom. I just wish I could shake this feeling.",1
"I just want to feel normal again,how can one do such a thing? Just a college student who wants to feel somewhat sane again. Itâ€™s been almost three months since my blood clot and although Iâ€™ve adapted to things I still donâ€™t feel like myself. Prior to today I was living in fear, constantly thinking about how things affect me and the worst possible outcome. These thoughts took over everything in my life, even before this clot I was and an over thinker. Iâ€™ve never been on medication for anxiety and just got on it, so hopefully that will help some current thoughts of fear fade. â€œWill I wake up tomorrow?â€

Throughout these months I have been to numerous doctors appointments and check ups, my body just wants to have multiple issues this year I guess. One problem after the next and the moment when my fear starts to subside another issue arises, school. I started to feel better, healthy in a way, yet because I was so determined to feel humane again I fell behind. Some professors were understanding, others focused more on the needed work rather than my health. Little do they all know that if my grades fall, I lose my scholarship. Three years down the drain right there. â€œHow do I explain to professional people that I was afraid to live? Or that my meds persistently make me tired?â€

I know in my heart, mind and soul that there are people out there who have it SO much worse. Believe me when I say I â€œoverthinkâ€, I do. You could make eye contact with me and Iâ€™d think something is automatically wrong with me. I donâ€™t have time for counseling because I fear it would interfere with school. Iâ€™m not one to vent, no one ever has their full attention so I keep everything in. But goodness, Iâ€™m so tired of living in fear. The idea of being told how super rare my case was and that Iâ€™m lucky to even be here lives in the back of my head. 

If anyone has advice with life after a blood clot, anxiety, college or anything I could really use it. 
I know my post was extremely jumbled and vague, for that I am sorry. Itâ€™s an accurate description of my jumbled mind.",1
"Heart palpitations So I started having heart palpitations when I was younger, got it checked, it was just an atrial flutter so nothing. Last year I was jacked up on caffeine and I'd say a little depressed and I had a stimulant induced panic attach (felt like I was gonna die). Quit caffeine and could workout and everything like normal. A few weeks later I had a night of binge drinking and woke up at 5 am to my heart pounding out of my chest which sent me into another panic attack. Now whenever my heart rate goes up, whether working out or drinking, I start to get anxiety and feel like I'm just gonna drop dead. Has anyone else had this?",1
"Thyroid cancer? Lymphoma? Random infection? I'm a 21 year old male.

 20 days ago I started feeling pain in the lower right part of my throat right above my collarbone. Halfway through the week I noticed a lump was there and made an appointment with my doctor. Doctor sent me for an ultrasound and found a 3cm lump in my neck but couldn't make out what exactly it was, so I was sent for a CT scan. The CT scan results showed that this tumor was near a muscle and lymph node. It looked suspicious to her and she also saw 2 other minor swollen lymph nodes so she referred me to a much better hospital (Vanderbilt) so that they could do their own tests. 

That was 12 days ago. This past Friday I had a fine needle biopsy done on the lump and got the results back yesterday. Apparently cancer wasn't detected and bacteria wasn't either but I did see something about 2+ polys. The test was essentially inconclusive but whatever it was it looked ""infectious"" and ""something on the uncommon side"", according to my doctor. 

My doctor was going to prescribe me Augmentin but since I am allergic I was prescribed Clindamycin. He wants to try me on that for a week and see if it helps. However, the day after the biopsy was done I have started experiencing slight pain right under my adam's apple when I yawn or look down. Seems like there is a bump there too. I let my doctor know this yesterday but he still wants to go through with the antibiotic for a week to see if anything changes. 

I don't really notice any other symptoms. I think my mouth has been a bit more dry as of late but nothing crazy. I was pretty worried early on but started to get over it until this other lump showed up. Wouldn't the CT scan from just over a week ago detected this new lump? I feel like I should be relieved that they didn't find anything malignant but I'm also worried that maybe they missed it or didn't get a proper reading. I have all the trust in the world in this hospital but my nerves are getting the best of me. Sorry if this is kind of all over the place. ",1
"Hows do you differentiate between imagined problems and real problems? (Long rant) Since I was probably 19/20 I have had a roller coaster of health anxiety. It all started with an actual kidney issue which later resolved itself and the only possible cause was ""stress"". Since then I have had a huge fear of STI's which led to my ultimate fear of cancer and warts caused by HPV (especially throat/mouth). I have always had some form of anxiety, when I was younger I'd pull out my eyelashes and scour my face for blemishes. I believe this has led to me being so hard on my self that I notice any imperfection. I have tonsil stones and while I stuck my finger down my throat I went past my tonsils this time ( gross I know) and I felt a bump, almost like a skin tag. This led to me feeling so panicked  I became physically ill  and left work early. Since then I've been googling and come to the conclusion that I can't keep doing this to myself. Normal people do not stick their fingers down their throat to find god knows what. Of course It's going to feel weird down there.

I understand this new thought will not pass immediately but how do you guys differentiate real vs imagined issues? How do you calm yourself down? I am at my wit's end, my gf is too. I'm sick of being withdrawn and lying to her about what's wrong. I'm sick of going down rabbits holes for hours on end. I'm sick of physically checking my self countless times. I'm just sick of it. Sometimes the only times I find any relief is when I am in actual distress from a confirmed ailment and that's just sad.",1

"2 things Hello! Iâ€™ve been suffering with anxiety most of my life but got diagnosed officially in college. Anyway I am on Zoloft and am doing well. However there are two things that have been driving me crazy and I was wondering if anyone else gets this. 

1) ever since I was little I would try to fall asleep but I would have the urge to urinate. It would frustrate me SO much because it literally made my skin crawl. I would get up and only go a tiny bit. This would happen about 4-5 times and I finally would calm my body down and fall asleep. Well Iâ€™m an adult now and this still happens from time to time. Itâ€™s so annoying and Iâ€™m not sure why it happens? Itâ€™s such an urge to go and I canâ€™t shake it off until I literally go to the bathroom. 

2) Iâ€™m on birth control and I have bad ice pick needle headaches. Iâ€™ve kept a headache log and it seems to happen soon before my period. However I am convinced that I have a brain tumor or some type of brain thing thatâ€™s causing me these HORRIBLE headache pains. Itâ€™s always the left aide of my head and the pain feels like someone is putting an ice pick in my head real quick then over and over again. (It  happens minutes from each other and then some time will go by but it will randomly happen again) my doctor said I could get an MRI but I donâ€™t want to because a) Iâ€™m scared if they do find something and b) I am just crazy and nothings wrong with me. Ps. I have a nose ring that I refuse to take out because I did once during surgery and it closed up. 

Iâ€™m a 26 year old healthy female.. on birth control, Zoloft and have hypothyroidism. (On meds as well) basically Iâ€™m just looking if anyone else has these feelings?!! 

Thanks so much. This community has helped a lot. Even though we all deal with this everyday and itâ€™s a pain... itâ€™s nice to know Iâ€™m not the only one who has to suffer through this. :) ",1
"Sleep disorder - heart starts pounding, thoughts races at 3am **like clockwork** every night I'm at my wit's end here. By all appearances I seem like a pretty mentally stable person. I've never experienced depression and am even-tempered, keeping cool and civil in most situations. But every single night, like clockwork, at 3am I get these raging panic attacks and can't sleep. Whether I go to bed exhausted at 10pm, or leisurely after bath/chamomile tea/meditation at 11 or midnight, almost like an internal alarm, I'm ALWAYS back up at 3am, my mind screaming panic and negative thoughts that I'll fail at everything, I'm a waste of space, nothing I do will ever work.

"Painful pinching head pain... Very scared A few weeks ago I had a really bad panic attack about having a blood clot from a really bad leg pain..it turned out to be nothing but since then I started getting these short, pinching bursts of pain on the top right side of my head in the same spot. At first they only happened once or twice a day, but now some days they happen more frequently or hurt more/less.
 My neck and back muscles on the same side have been sore, and sometimes when I'm slouching or just getting out of bed is when the pain happens. I went to the doctor and she asked my family history of aneurysms, which was none. She scheduled me an MRI for next week but she said she really doesn't think it's anything....

"On the Here and Now Looking out at a beautiful spring day I find myself buried in anxiety.  Thoughts crash into my mind

â€œ*Iâ€™ve lost weight recently, what if itâ€™s the beginning of the endâ€*

*â€œI feel dizzy, oh god thereâ€™s something wrong I know itâ€*

*â€œWhat if I stop looking and miss an important symptom?â€*

&amp;#x200B;

I am so fucking tired of this.  We spend so much of our day worrying about the future or ruminating on our past.  But we have *only* now.  Our consious mind doesnâ€™t inhabit the future or the past, it inhabits this very moment.  Right. Now.  

And right now I donâ€™t want to feel anxious.  Donâ€™t get me wrong, I donâ€™t want to feel anxious ever but I can only change that *right now*.  The best part?  The more I change that right now, the easier it will be to change that for future me.  

&amp;#x200B;

So starting right now Iâ€™m going to:

1. **STOP GOOGLING (and body checks).**  My doctor once told me I have â€œgoogleitisâ€ and the best and only cure was to just stop.  Helpful advice there.    
Obviously go to your doctor if you're worried about something, and by all means, get a second opinion if you're still concerned.  Beyond that, leave it to the professionals to diagnose.  
2. **Stop seeking reassurance for every symptom.**  I know what people are going to say to me.  â€œYouâ€™re fineâ€, â€œStatistically that only has a 0.00001% chanceâ€, â€œbreathe deeplyâ€.  I can do this for myself.  I can be kind and firm with my own mind.  
3. **Stop asking â€œwhat ifâ€**.  Things can and will happen.  Worrying about the future will never help.  We can only live our best lives now, and take life as it comes.
4. **Actually acknowledge statistics.**  Next time I feel a symptom Iâ€™m going to ask myself â€œwhatâ€™s the most likely cause?â€  Pretty much any symptom can be better attributed to harmless things like lack of sleep, too much coffee, too much anxious thinking, and so on.
5. **Recognize and challenge maladaptive thought patterns.** The more I think in anxious ways, the more my brain will automatically go back to those patterns.  Time to see those thoughts for what they are: unrealistic beliefs and fears.  

&amp;#x200B;

I know anxiety is going to get worse at the start, but I can handle that.  

&amp;#x200B;

I can do this.  So can you.  ",1
"There is always light at the other end of the tunnel! Just a little backstory; I have had hypochondria that has steadily i creased in terms of severity, since late last November. Over this period of time I have been worried about; going deaf, having heart disease/dying of a heart attack, going blind, having the Hantavirus, having lung cancer, and the most recent one - skin cancer. Throughout all of my fictional illnesses, even with the consideration of how rare they are to my specific case, I continued to believe I had them. I mean heck, I live in Australia and there are only 15 cases a year of the HantaVirus out of the whole country. Didnâ€™t matter. My brain knew I would be in that 0.00000062% chance of getting it. Although of this considerably unrealistic thinking, I still believe that deep down I knew I did not have the virus. Enter, Skin Cancer. Out of all of my fears, this one really stood out to me. I had an â€˜oh shitâ€™ moment where I realised my petty fears before where nothing compared to this beast. Due to the fact I am a relatively avid golfer who plays without sunscreen and typically without a hat, this fear was so real to me. Book the doctors in, a 16 day wait I shit you not. In the beginning of this wait I was fine because my worries were on other things. However, approaching the date I developed absolute chaos inside of my head. I head to google and establish... â€œYep... must be Stage 4 skin cancer, this is the end.â€ For the week I could not attend school, maintaining the fear there was a long road of chemotherapy, doctors appointments and eventually death, ahead of me. Today I finally go in to the get the skin check. I was essentially prepared to have my life torn to shreds if I needed to get a biopsy, and then to wait for the results of said biopsy. Doc looks at practically every mole on my body - nothing. No stage 4 cancer. No risk of death. Just, nothing. Although other worries have taken the limelight of the skin cancer, I maintain a sense of happiness and humour about how much I work myself up. How much I google every single one of my bloody symptoms. Not just I however - we all do. This story was to simply let people know that there always light at the other end of the tunnel and I cannot say it enough - stop googling your symptoms. If you are really worried about something, get it checked up with your doctor ASAP and put your concerns put to rest by the professional! ",1

"Am I Going Crazy? So, Iâ€™m a healthy 27 year old American woman (today is my birthday) and the last few months have been almost unbearable and I canâ€™t seem to get a grip on anything. For reference, it all started last November when I started having pain in my upper left abdomen that wouldnâ€™t seem to go away. Iâ€™m currently living in Spain, which is where Iâ€™m currently living and working. My doctor said that I had acid reflux and told me to what I ate. Pain persisted, lots of mucus coming out, constipation, tons of gas. Decided to take a probiotic and managed to get my symptoms to disappear for a month while on winter break. Then in January, the pain came back. My stools were hard and dark, and the pain was consistent. Had an ultrasound and was told that I had tons of gas in my colon so they couldnâ€™t see clearly, but my other organs looked good. But then, my coworker suddenly began having blood in her stool too and many intestine issues. Turns out that she had worms. I decided to check my stool, found something that looked like a worm, went to the emergency room, tool mebendazol to get rid of the worms (This also made sense because I lived in Asia for 2 years before Spain and had just recently moved).
Just after my first dose of mebendazole, I started to have a weird feeling in my lungs. Felt like I couldnâ€™t breathe in all the way, but that was it. Anyway, in addition to that, I began to have sinus pressure, a mild sore throat, and drainage. 
I took my second dose of the worm medicine, had a stool sample that came back clear of everything (no blood), and even a chest X-ray that was clear. Iâ€™ve been secretly worried that I have colon cancer since a friend of mine suddenly died at age 25 from it. She had no symptoms and went to the doctor with a persistent cough and ended up having stage 4. Since my lung issues flared up, Iâ€™ve been so worried that I have some cancer that has metastasized and went to my lungs. I havenâ€™t been able to completely shake this cold yet and itâ€™s been over 3 or 4 weeks. I still wake up and spit up yellowish colored spit. Lungs feel a bit off. To make matters worse, Iâ€™m still having stomach problems after being cleared of the worms and my doctor says that I probably have IBS. Then, last night, I began having heart palpitations and rushed to the emergency room. My EKG was normal and my blood test was normal. She said I have pvcs and need to relax. Honestly, I just feel like Iâ€™m shutting down and I havenâ€™t felt healthy in a long time. I canâ€™t seem to shake this chest cold, my digestive problems are still there, have some reflux too, and now pvcs. I feel like Iâ€™m a mess... just spent the morning of my 27th birthday in the emergency room getting the tests on my heart. Can anyone relate?",1

I am really suffering in a way that makes life absolute torture. I have health problems, however they're compounded *significantly* by my constant fears of death and cardiovascular/heart-related health anxiety. 

Does anyone here ever feel like suicide is rational when your life has been distilled to daily panic attacks of the worst kind and constant thinking/fears of sudden death or further disability (i.e. strokes, fatal arrythmias, heart failure, etc.)

I don't want to die, I fear the unknown so intensely, however I feel that I deserve dignity and mercy for my situation.

"Swollen lymph node, rash, dermatits and surprise another lymph node today What the fuck is going on with my body?

In October 2018, my perioral dermatitis flared up again after accidentally eating gluten. It was around the time of the holidays and i was stressed due to major family issues. December comes and I start to notice and itch on the back of my neck. I also notice after I eat a heavy meal, I have this mild pain on the left side under my rib cage. Spleen? January - the rash is a deep red, unbearable itchy, oozing and now paired with a swollen lymph node.

I change up my diet to vegan because I figured it was keto catching up to me. That helped and the rash slooowwwwllly got better but still lingers. Fast forward to this week - the itch is mostly gone but the lymph node is still there albeit smaller. Yesterday, I finally got my hair done because I couldn't previously with it so itchy. I noticed a deep pimple on the opposing side of my scalp. This morning, I now have a swollen lymph node where the pimple is. I also am hardly eating,not very hungry and have managed to lose around 10lbs in a month but this could be due to vegan, mostly raw diet.

"Could those symptoms be caused by stress/anxiety? Afraid of cancer Iâ€™ve been feeling really anxious about some things Iâ€™ve been getting recently. It started with sudden one-sided tinnitus at my right ear for at most, five seconds. Iâ€™ve dismissed it, since it seemed to be common. But then Iâ€™ve started to feel lightheaded for one or two seconds randomly, which led to more searching, and the discovery that one sided tinnitus could be a red flag for cancer. And thus started my anxiety

Besides the tinnitus and lightheadedness, Iâ€™ve also had some muscle spasms. Not really common, once or twice a week only, and itâ€™s just on the fingers of the right hand, along with a  a weird twitching feeling on what I suppose is the median nerve.  What left me more alarmed though, is that today, my vision suddenly became blurry, accompanied by a headache, lasting for three or four seconds. Never had that before.

Iâ€™ve been very anxious about this, and Iâ€™m hoping that those symptoms are not that uncommon or at least, anxiety/stress induced. Should I go see a doctor, or just wait to see if it gets better? 

TL;DR: lightheadedness, one-sided tinnitus (SBUTTs), some hand twitching and quick head pain with blurry vision. Hopefully itâ€™s just all anxiety",1
"Possible mono...maybe something worse Noticed swollen tonsils/scratchy throat last Thursday.

Doctor ordered some blood work to test for mono but to only go through with it if my condition worsens

"23 year old male with Lymphoma like symptoms Hi everyone!

&amp;#x200B;

I have had an interesting few months, and would like to share my story with everyone! Would love some feedback given I am not seeing an Internal Medicine Doctor until the end of April.. Here goes!

&amp;#x200B;

Background information:

In May 2017, I had a nice EBV infection that lasted a year. Additionally, I have thalassemia minor which I believe has never effected me, and Asthma which is mostly brought out due to my dust allergies. 

&amp;#x200B;

Current issues:

In February this year, my cheeks randomly started swelling which has never really happened to me before. I didn't think much of it, but after a week of them staying swelled I visited a Doctor. He said it's likely due to the cold weather and sent me off. 

About a week later I developed a nasty lung infection, it caused my lymph nodes to swell like crazy, and a very mild sore throat for a few days. I went on Antibiotics and the symptoms went away. 

About a week after that, I got food poisoning which then eased itself out after a couple days.

&amp;#x200B;

After the food poisoning however, some of the initial symptoms came back. My cheeks kept swelling, and my lymph nodes (on my neck) were overly active. I went to the doctor, and he gave me some Ventilin and another inhaler, as he thought it was due to lung inflammation. 

&amp;#x200B;

A couple weeks later I started developing fatigue, I could sleep 10 hours and feel as if I didn't even go to bed. Then at around dinner time every day I would feel sick to my stomach, and extremely light headed, I didn't get it but thought maybe I was just stressed. 

&amp;#x200B;

I then got another lung infection which went away naturally, but after this one, the facial swelling and lymph node action came back harder than ever. I even started developing numbness on my temples during night time, and have been noticing almost rapid hair loss on my hairline (Never had any signs of balding before). Which now leaves to the last few days..

&amp;#x200B;

I went into the ER yesterday as I knew this was problematic. They said they couldn't find anything alarming in the blood tests, but did notice my spleen was enlarged and that they will perform an ultrasound. The results from the iron test and stool analysis won't be back until next week.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to be honest, I have had health issues my whole life, this is the first time in my life where I am really really scared. I have googled the symptoms as you do.. And really the one that fits the story the best is Lymphoma..

&amp;#x200B;

I'm curious to hear what people think.

"Chest pain anxiety. CHD &amp; open heart surgery survivor. Apologies for this wall of text. I just need help. 

So I'm new to reddit and to this sub. I know that chest pain is a very common symptom/trigger of HA, but I haven't been able to find any resources about cases similar to my own, although I'm sure they must exist out there. 

So I am a moderately healthy 25 year old woman. I excersise, I eat healthy, I was slightly overweight as a teen, but I've been at a healthy weight for the past 4-5 years. I was born with a somewhat serious congenital heart defect (CHD), an atrial septal defect (ASD) to pe precise. At the age of 5 I received corrective surgery for this defect, and have been considered healthy and symptom free ever since this surgery. I have had no major health events since this time, and I have never had any sort of restrictions placed on my physical activity levels by my cardiologist. 4 years ago I entered into a long distance relationship with the man who would eventually become my husband, and it was around this time that my HA began. I believe it was triggered by my fears that something would happen to one of us while we were apart, and that we would never see each other again because of sudden death due to illness or a freak accident. I began to be plagued by images of him dropping dead of a heart attack or getting hit by a car (same for myself). We lived in 2 different countries, and usually spent 8-9 months apart in between brief visits, and as our time apart progressed I was aware of new unhealthy habits forming (googling symptoms, anxiety induced nausea/chest pains/numbness/tingling/jaw pain). 

We are now married and have been living together for a year, and although I am happier than ever, all of my bad HA related habits have decided to make a home in my brain. I feel so unlike myself as I have never expeirenced anything quite like this before. I was so caught up with dealing with a long distance/international relationship that I didn't do anything to stop the progress of this anxiety and now it has become an integral part of my day to day life. Like many of you I experience chest pain, numbness, tightness, tingling, and nausea, and I have been to see my doctor on a few of these occasions, and have been told that I am fine. I have even been to the hospital (same results). Again, I know this is all very common for those suffering from HA. My added complication comes from my history of heart defect/heart surgery. I wish that I could just erase my knowledge of this event since it really exacerbates my HA and often sends me into a spiral. Although I know most of my chest pains are benign, the fact that I have had major surgery lends just a bit more credence to the HA voice telling me I'm dying, and this is destroying my mental and physical health. 

It doesn't help that I can't find any resources on living post-op from a pediatric heart surgery in your 20's/30's, and what to expect as you age. All of the materials I find online about what to expect after a heart surgery are clearly directed towards 55+ year olds, which is very alienating. I am always the youngest person in the cardiologist's office by several decades, and I've never met another person in my age group that has had open heart surgery. I've looked for support groups for young adults living post-op from CHD's, but I haven't been able to find anything. 

My question is this. Does anyone on here relate to my story/situation? Does anyone here have a history of CHD and open heart surgery? Since I can't find any information about this, my HA is telling me this is because they all died young and my time is limited, although I know this cannot be true. I just want to talk to someone about their experience with this and get support from people who know where I'm coming from. AH and CHD open heart surgery are an abundantly shitty combination and I know my current anxiety levels are unsustainable. I can't live like this. 

Even if you haven't had open heart surgery, any advice/resources would be welcome. I'm very overwhelmed and not sure how to deal with this. ",1
"Unsubscribing today. Thanks for all of your support. This sub has helped me through a lot of health concerns, but today I'm finally in a place where I can deal with it on my own so I'm posting to hopefully help someone else.

I started off as a mess and eventually got a full heart/body checkup including an MRI and wore a heart monitor for 24-hours to check out my palpitations. After being told that everything is fine that was a big step. Getting a professional, comprehensive medical diagnosis to rule out what you're worried about goes a long way. After chest pains, numbness, tingling in my limbs, dizzy spells, being sent to the ER because urgent care thinks I might be having a stroke, and a ton of other shit, something outside my control changed: my stress level. I took on a different role at work that is much less stressful. I had no idea how big of an impact this was because I didn't consider myself ""stressed"" but several symptoms subsided with this change like everything digestive and the chest pain is less frequent. After I was told the chest pains are costochondritis (inflammation of the rib tissues, read: stress-induced) I saw a chiropractor for about 5 months who taught me some stretches and self-adjustments I could do with a back roller and now I've trained myself not to panic when I feel those chest pains. Just do the stretches and trust that I'm fine and sure enough, I am. Also, my doctor told me to cut caffeine and I didn't listen. I am a coffee junkie and cut back, but didn't cut it out entirely. Well recently I switched to decaf (I know, stick with me) and it's been life-changing. Yes, this is obvious. Yes, we all know caffeine raises your physiological arousal level. But many of us keep consuming caffeine not realizing just *how* much it actually contributes to the cycle. I'm a much happier person on decaf and I don't think I'll go back. I found out all of the shit I was dealing with can be caused by anxiety. So this whole time, it was the fear of a health problem that was causing health problems. Stress impacts us more than we realize!

So to recap, here are the things my dumb ass put off doing forever that really made a huge impact:

-Get a doctor's opinion. As in, a thorough one if possible instead of just a quick visit. They will run some tests and give you a professional take on it. When you get this - TRUST IT. If you have reason to believe the doctor missed something, get a second opinion but really you should trust the doctor.

-Manage your external stress. This doesn't mean quit your job, but if something is stressing you out (a situation at work, a significant other, family) take some real steps to get out of that situation! In my case it was a lateral transfer and a change in responsibilities but man did it lower my stress levels.

-Cut the caffeine and any other stimulants including recreational ones. If you struggle with anxiety, your brain is already pumping you full of stress hormones in a fight-or-flight response. You absolutely do not to make it worse. Even a little can impact some people (like me, apparently).

-For the love of Reddit, never Google your symptoms.

The terrible thing about anxiety is once it has you, it's a downward spiral. But the inverse is true too. Once you are confident in your situation and know the quirks of your own body, you can come out of it quickly too. Hope this helps someone.",1

"Lightheaded/ dizzy after walking I (33/m/222lbs) recently started my weight loss journey (down 27lbs since january) and started going to the gym this week. I spent 45 minutes on the treadmill just walking and afterwards felt very dizzy and lightheaded. I make sure to drink lots of water throughout the day. I did lead a very sedentary lifestyle before this, and have recently quit smoking. Does anyone else ever feel this way after walking? Is this normal? Am I just THAT out of shape?",0
"Worried about Smoke So I never smoked and always thought that was that, but lately Iâ€™ve been reading about the dangers of second hand smoke.

Iâ€™m freaking out. I know itâ€™s not as bad as me smoking, and for years there were no smoking laws (remember non smoking sections on airplanes?) and most people were fine.

"Antibiotic cocktail and side effects Disgusting me has a bacterial infection in the stomach and I'll have to take 15 pills every day of antibiotics to get rid of it. Normally I won't take a look at the side effects because I know I will go insane about them, but after my mother saw the prescription she said I should consider another form of antibiotic treatment that only has 70% success rate (compared to 95%) but less side effects. SO I looked up the side effects and its worse than anything I've ever taken. It's nausea and diarrhea and vomiting in over 10% of cases and a condition with black burnt skin and multiple organ failure with unknown probability. As I'm already vegetarian and you're not allowed to eat dairy products I have to go vegan for a week and I'm not allowed to go outside in the sun cause the medication will cause my skin to burn in the sun.

I can't find the side effects for the other therapy but I also I want to be done with the whole thing if I survive the ten days.  I'll probably take the pills but I will properly go crazy and miserable too.",1
"Does anyone worry about long term quality of life? So for example, I have a had a fear for the last couple years now that my jaw ache (probably from anxious grinding) is going to get worse and worse and I will damage my joints and live a miserable life.

Anyone else get instances like this?",1
"That awkward moment when your health anxiety was 110% accurate. Fml. Iâ€™ve spent my whole life not feeling right. My immune system has always been shit. Seizure activity as a child-teenager. Anyways, Iâ€™m 25 now and I had my adrenal gland removed a few months ago due to a benign hormone-secreting adenoma. It was found via MRI in October. 

Not even a couple weeks after surgery, I noticed extreme mental changes. Which led to paranoia. And then I lost 30+lbs and stopped sleeping completely. I would get SO angry over shit that wasnâ€™t even important and I had to literally shut it down by cutting myself off from people. My hormones were a mess according to labs. I just KNEW something else was wrong.

A week ago today, I got an MRI which confirmed a brain tumor (of the pituitary). I have to have my concerns because I work in the medical field and I usually know what something is the second it starts creeping up. But I thought it was impossible to have another one present itself, even though my last tumor was benign. Fml.",1

I just want to feel normal, if only for a few moments. Iâ€™m starving because Iâ€™ve been too worried to eat all day, plus the random nausea.

"I feel a colon cancer meltdown coming on I probably wouldnâ€™t be worrying so much about colon cancer if I hadnâ€™t spent nearly 24 years of my life being fed ultra processed foods and then going on to cook ultra processed foods for myself.

Iâ€™m just now starting to figure out whatâ€™s good for my colon even though I thought I was doing things right (eating frozen vegan patties which may be even WORSE now that I think about it. I was worried about processed MEAT only and not processed meals in general).

Iâ€™ve had hemorrhoid symptoms lasting over 2 months now (itching and bright red spots). Bowel habits constantly change. Lot of gas, bloating, and nausea. Feeling hungry more than usual.

"Wall of Eye Floaters Help So I have floaters. Evident by the fact I'm posting here. Whether they stay or go away in a few years, I don't care. 23, so I have all the time to wait. One thing that I've recently noticed though is that when I almost close my eyes completely and look up at the sky during the day, I can see an entire faint sheet of what I assume is the liquid my floaters are in, and I can see the entire field of my vision is in what essentially looks like a very faint wall of bubbly protiens and crap. When my eyes are wide open it's harder to see but in the sky I can still ever so slightly notice it. My question is, has anyone had this along with the more prominent floaters and did the wall eventually go away? I don't mind the individual ones but having literally all my vision be through this murky shit is stressing me out.

"I have a ridiculous fear of HIV/AIDS Hey all,

I just found this community today, and I just want to express my irrational fear of getting HIV/AIDS.
So, today I was doing laundry (university dorms) and I realised there was some face towels from another person in the wash after I washed my clothes.

I have a small cut on my hand and I for *god knows what reason* am afraid of getting HIV or full blown AIDS, because in my brain, I touched a facecloth of someone I don't know, and don't know their history (its a uni dorm so sexual activity is obviously bound to happen)

"I just found out I'm diabetic. What now? Hey folks. Yesterday I went in for a routine DOT physical to get my medical card updated. These happen every two years to make sure my health is in check for driving a rig. 

So, I go in to my appointment. I give a urine sample. There is a massive glucose concentration. They use a diabetic meter and my glucose level was a 257. With almost no symptoms apart from occasionally dry mouth/thirst. I went and immediately got an a1c test to determine what's going on. (I understand this won't find Type I, but it's worth doing). I've taken my blood sugar three times since. Last test yesterday was still in the 250s, today it's been 157 for two tests.

I'm worried. I enrolled in insurance yesterday because I'm not financially prepared for the lab work, but I cannot continue driving until this is diagnosed and handled.

Hello! I am a 20yr old male (soon to be 21) that has indeed been diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Panic Disorder. I have dealt with these issues for around 6-8yrs of my life. Part of my anxiety issues is changes in eating habits. Things such as me not eating when get a full blown anxiety attack, feeling some stomach cramps when eating certain foods or eating them in certain locations, and sometimes feeling discomfort when I have a BM but not all the time.

I am writing this because this week has been super stressful causing me to have a few anxiety breakdowns (one major one yesterday). Today is the aftermath and my mind is really letting me have it. As of now I'm hungry which makes me anxious which makes me not eat which makes me feel sick which makes me more anxious. It's perpetual :T

I don't want to keep going through this. I have been to many doctors, have not been given meds and have underwent many tests. I also did go see a therapist for a while but stopped going when my anxiety issues went away.

**my point is**

Should I go back to my psychiatrist, reopen my case and perhaps get medication?

Or perhaps this is seems more like a digestive issue and I should see a gastroenterologist?

Or should I go back to see my therapist?

Or lastly do all three?:&lt;

"Struggling with fear of carcinogens everywhere  

Hello, just wondering if anyone has advice, info, anything relating to this would really be great; I have a problem with fear about contamination but mainly in the form of long-term damage, ie being exposed to a unknown carcinogen, or drinking water with lead, or exposure to anything that is deadly / harmful, but only through exposure over time.

This is mostly fueled by any story of ""new chemical used in products and only 5/10/20 years later people confirm it's a carcinogen / otherwise dangerous"".

Because of this I get stressed out with chemical things like cleaning products, detergents, anything scented, general air pollutants, clothing dye, any drinking water, plastics touching food, heavily processed foods, and so much more. 

 I'm struggling to get over it because these cases do happen, and I wouldn't know there was a problem until it was too late; I can't shake the feeling it is rational to at least have some skepticism... but I know it's impossible to know about everything and I want to stop stressing out so much. any coping tips or advice would be great, thank you.

"Pro tip: don't Google symptoms if you're logged into Facebook. They will use the data from your searches to give you relevant ads and articles and it will exacerbate your HA.

It's been really helpful in taming my anxieties.

I don't recall a condom breaking but sometimes the other dude would give the condom to me, and Im scared that they might have done something to it. I'm just so frightened. I tell myself that I should go to a nearby clinic and get tested, but what if something results that makes me fall into a depression. The semester isn't over and my life would completely change. I just need some piece of mind. My spring break wasn't even relaxing due to me freaking out. Any advice?",1
"Depression or fear of it? Hi guys, this is the first time I post in this subreddit, so, let's get started!  
   
For about two weeks I have been feeling very frightened about the idea of â€‹â€‹being depressed, also because this anxiety is accompanied by a kind of weight that I feel inside my chest and that accompanies me all the days. 

I haven't lost interest in activities or in socializing, but when I am at home alone I start to think and look on the internet for symptoms and feelings about depression, and end up feeling scared, anguished and sad with this feeling of heavy head and the impossibility of thinking positive.

What do you think, is it all the fault of anxiety and hypochondria that have been with me for years, or is it the beginning of a depressive phase? ",1
"Random Twitching / ALS Fears I was hoping to find some relief here. About 5 months ago I had some bad panic attacks, with high blood pressure, likely due to high stress. Same deal, thinking I had heart issues. I've been on the generic version of Buspar and a blood pressure medication since then. Things seems ok, until I started to have panic attacks again. A friend told me he had twitching issues with the Buspar, so I'm hoping maybe thats it. 

For the last 3-4 weeks I have been having all sorts of weird twitches EVERYWHERE.  Mostly been in the bridge of my nose, but also in my back, head, arms, neck, abdomen, legs, knees, elbow, and butt. It's very random just a small twitch here and there, and there seems to be no pattern to it. They usually will last a couple seconds. I've been having bad anxiety and stress lately. My wife and I had a baby recently and when I got back to work from my leave, a bunch of people were laid off. A week into being back at work I started having bad panic attacks, chest pain, reflux, I started to get spasms in my esophagus, and trouble breathing, which made me think I was having a heart attack. I then started obsessing thinking I had a heart condition. I got checked out by the doctor and some blood work done and everything checked out ok. I was relieved to hear that things were fine. My doctor switched out my blood pressure medication, but then I started getting muscle twitches all over. Thinking it was because the medication, I went back to my old BP medicine, but after being off of it for over a week, it's still happening My family has a history of ALS, seems to happen later in life, 60+, but when I googled muscle twitching, my anxiety completely went off the rails. The twitching seems less severe, but it's still happening.

I went back to the doctor do more blood work, check for an electrolyte imbalance. I should have the results back at the end of the week. I started CBT last week with a therapist, but the unknown leaves me constantly fearing the worst, and I'm finding it hard to find relief. I haven't been sleeping well because of the baby which could be contributing to the problem. 

Has anyone else had issues with muscle twitching following panic attacks?",1

"Health Anxiety: A Hypochondriacâ€™s Guide - A NEW PODCAST! Hello everybody,

As a longtime reader and occasional poster on this here sub, I just wanted to let you know about a new podcast episode Iâ€™ve recorded, in which I discuss my experience with health anxiety. I also share things that helped me overcome and deal with this often hellish condition. 

[The episode can be found here on iTunes.](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/heavy-mental-podcast/id1454724561?mt=2)

Weâ€™re also on Spotify too â€” just look up â€œHeavy Mentalâ€. 

Iâ€™m also the dude that wrote about health anxiety in a blog post, which I think some of you mightâ€™ve already read?

[You can read the blog post â€” that I reference during the podcast â€” here.](https://rhysowenking.wordpress.com/2018/03/04/healthanxiety/)

I hope everyoneâ€™s having a good day and holding up okay. Keep going, if I can do this, you can do this.

Thanks for looking.

"Signs you DONT have cancer https://www.google.fi/amp/s/www.thesun.co.uk/living/1950603/doctor-goes-through-ten-signs-that-suggest-you-dont-have-cancer/amp/

A great article I found that helps me battle my cancer anxiety. Most of the health websites list vague widespread symptoms that can convince even the healthiest person they are dying. Iâ€™d like to hear what symptoms can help us anxious peeps to rule out those pesky deadly diseases. 

So, pitch in, please:)",1
"seizure worries? hi everyone! 

i need someone to tell me iâ€™m not losing it. lately iâ€™ve been worrying that iâ€™m just going to have a seizure. iâ€™ve completely convinced myself that itâ€™s going to happen when iâ€™m not at my house. 

yesterday i went out to eat with my parents and we were sitting in chairs at the restaurant and i leaned my head back to laugh and of course, i hit my head. at the time it didnâ€™t feel hard enough to do anything but now itâ€™s really worrying me. iâ€™ve tried to avoid googling anything so i wonâ€™t further my own worries.  

my cousin has seizures  but no one else in the family does and iâ€™m just feeling crummy about this. the rational part of my brain tells me iâ€™m fine but the panicky/anxious part tells me not to go to school or work because youâ€™re going to be uncomfortable and definitely have a seizure. ",1
"Maybe you do have a health condition, but it's more likely to be benign/chronic than whatever you're imagining I used to have bad health anxiety. Until I was diagnosed with POTS: postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.

What is POTS? At it's core, it's an increase in heartrate when you're standing. To be diagnosed you need to have a standing heartrate that's 30+bpm higher than your supine (lying down) heartrate.

But what is POTS really? It's a complex condition of the autonomic nervous system. There are dozens of possible symptoms, all somewhat benign, ranging from heart palpitations to nausea to trouble regulating temperature. Some people with POTS aren't affected much while others are confined to a wheelchair because of their fainting spells. Yes it can be a terrible experience, but it is *not fatal.*

So why am I telling you guys this?

Because there's a 100 conditions like POTS. Simple, relatively ""harmless"" conditions that make you feel uncomfortable, but pose no risk to your life. To name a few:

* Raynauds disease - intensely cold fingers/toes
* Fibromyalgia - pain/aches in muscles
* Arthritis - pain in bones
* Asthma - difficulty breathing
* TMJ - jaw pain, headaches
* Crohn's disease - abdominal pain, gas, diarrhea, vomiting
* Cyclic vomiting disease - recurring vomiting spells
* Ovarian cysts - pain in pelvis, back or side
* Hypothyroidism - fatigue, weight gain, hair loss
* Anemia - fatigue, coldness
* Sleep apnea - sleepiness, snoring

I'm not saying that it's easy to live with these conditions. No way. Most of them suck. HOWEVER, they are not cancer, they are not heart disease, they are not multiple sclerosis.

So when you're listing your symptoms, focus on what the *most probably cause*. Neck pain? You probably have ""text neck"". Stomachache? You probably ate something that your stomach doesn't agree with. Headache? You probably have some environmental or dietary trigger.

/r/healthanxiety is very near and dear to my heart. I spent many anxious nights terrified because of heart palpitations, difficulty breathing, muscle cramps. I can't tell you how much of a weight off my shoulders its been to have a diagnosis. (I should've mentioned that the caused of my POTS is mitochondrial dysfunction, which comes with another huge slew of symptoms)

I hope anyone here with an undiagnosed chronic condition can find a diagnosis and treatment asap. I know it's hard to keep your head on straight until that happens, but try to! You are your best advocate.

"Health anxiety is affecting my relationships Iâ€™ve been a â€worrierâ€ for all my life about everything. Health anxiety is just a part of it. Now Iâ€™ve come to the point where itâ€™s starting to negatively affect my relationships especially with my partner. The worst of it being that i got drunk, lost memory for a bit, became convinced that i was taken advantage of and contracted an STD and created a weird situation in my relationship. There was no indication that this had happened, other than a minor cold that i was sure was a symptom of a disease.

Understandably he is upset and i felt guilty. It was awful and weâ€™re still in the middle of it. This has to serve as a wake up call that my life is so negatively affected by all this. Iâ€™ve been festering at home all evening not being able to do anything but worry. My head is in pieces. All iâ€™ve managed is to use reddit as an occasional distraction. I need help, i feel like iâ€™m lost in this. 

The point of my post was to hear success stories of others overcoming these fears and honestly to just find some hope and support. ",1
"In need of some advice/support Hey all! First I want to say thank you to everyone in this sub. Iâ€™ve been quietly reading your posts for months now and it is truly the reason I donâ€™t feel so alone anymore. 
Iâ€™ve been dealing with health anxiety since I was 12. I saw a poster in the nurseâ€™s office at school which explained the symptoms of menengitis and spent almost a year touching my chin to my neck to make sure I was okay.  Then, it turned into having anxiety about HIV/AIDS and lymphoma. My anxiety was so bad I had to drop out of my dream college because I couldnâ€™t handle it. 
I felt happy for years after that. I focused on other things. But this January something changed. I suddenly began feeling everything I used to before. Constantly worried about various diseases even after being reassured that I was okay. 
Itâ€™s straining my relationships with my family, my boyfriend, and my friends. My constant reassurance seeking is making everyone lose their patience with me. I feel like I canâ€™t handle it anymore. I sleep most of the day because thatâ€™s the only time when the terrible thoughts donâ€™t come. 
The worst part is this feeling I like to call â€œhappy...butâ€. It occurs in situations where I feel happy but cannot truly experience the moment for what it is because Iâ€™m worried. â€œIâ€™m happy...but I could have a diseaseâ€ â€œIâ€™m happy... but it will only be for a little while until the anxiety comes back.â€ 

Anyone else feel this way? ",1
"My fear if brain eating amoeba is ruining my life ? I'm new here, but I've been to counseling multiple times and I still can't get myself together.
So, it all started in December when I was taking a shower, and a droplet of water got in my nose and I snorted it, it ruined my entire Christmas cause for two whole weeks I was waiting to die. It totally traumatized me, I never got over it even when a month passed. 

When I shower, I hang a towel nearby and wipe my face whenever it gets wet . When I wash my face in the morning, I dry out my nose with a cloth after, even if I'm late for work. When I brush my teeth , I hold my breath. When it's raining outside, I breathe with my mouth . Sometimes when it's raining a truck will pass by and water will splash on my face and I'll need to go to the nearest gas station and get a tissue to dry my nose out if anything even got in there. I don't go swimming anymore, even though I used to do it as a sport. I'm always careful when drinking water, I'm even scared of my own spit when I laugh of it getting up my nose. I guess I'm just scared of water as a whole now, I know my fear is irrational and I can't even get the infection from most of these things. Also, I live in Canada where we've never even heard of this stuff before.

I even read you could get the intention from soil or dust. So I'm afraid to breathe in or touch my nose with a lot of things that I think have dust on them or dirt. I never even put my hands towards my face anymore without washing 4-5 times first.

I've started having severe existiential crisis caused by this, I'm always scared to die and it keeps me up at night. I just want to be normal again like before and not worry about these things anymore, but it's so hard.",1
"Blood in post nasal drip When I wake up in the morning and only in the morning I have what looks like blood mixed in with my phlegm. This has been going on for about 3 or 4 days.

I instantly am worried I have cancer or some other life threatening illness. I do have cobblestoning on my throat and believe I have some form of acid reflux. I also sleep with a fan on.

"Shortness of breath/Lymphoma/PE Hey guys,

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, I need to say I'm so glad I found this community ! I've read several post and it's good to see that I'm not alone with that hell that is health anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

I've always had anxiety but rarely experienced physical symptoms from it. For 5 days now, I really have trouble breathing. It feels like I'm always gasping for air. I did have chest pain for the first days but not so much now. I feel like something is stuck in my throat. 

&amp;#x200B;

All of this started because I found a painless lump in my neck about the size of a pea. Of course, I googled it and found it might be lymphoma. I also googled shortness of breath and found it might be PE (which is scary because my grand mother had two PE in fall).

&amp;#x200B;

I did a pulmonary Xray and blood test 1 month and half ago and everything was normal but I can't help but think of the worst. I'm fairly young (F 23) but the fear of having cancer or suddenly faint is intense. I have a doctor appointment coming up (not related to this) and I don't know what to tell her without sounding crazy lol.

"Anxiety over therapy Hii! 
 I live in Belarus and in my country there are no CBT practitioners. All our doctors can offer is pills. Maybe talking therapy. I don't want to spend my time just talking about my anxiety, it's not gonna help. 
I've been struggling with anxiety throughout my life. 
I had OCD (sometimes still have it), but overcame it on my own using Internet and articles of Dr. Steven Phillipson. 
I had GAD (just general anxiety 24/7) and overcame it by accepting using the book by Claire Weekes ""Hope and help for your nerves"". 
Now I suffer from severe health anxiety. 
I've read some books and other sufferers on forums told me some techniques. What I've been using is more ACT (acceptance and commitment therapy) than CBT. And it was quite helpful for me. I have always had problems challenging the thought, it's much easier to accept it and let it float past me as clouds as ""just anxiety"". 
Lately I've read on Wikipedia that CBT is a gold-standard approach. And developed anxiety - ""what if (yess classic what-if thought) the approach you've been using is wrong and is not recognized by therapists?"". I lack confidence, although I have tools. But I continue googling.( 
I understand this is just another anxiety about the therapy) maybe a sign I'm recovering.

"Panic, pain and tingling in limbs - is my birth control driving me crazy? Hi there everybody! It's my first time posting here but my anxiety is skyrocketing recently, so here's a quick summary of my problem:

I feel constantly stressed and pressured due to mental health reasons. Last year, during a very stressful stretch at work, I passed out the first time and I've had dizzy spells ever since. Had blood work and an examination with a heart rate monitor made, nothing major except for a slightly lower blood pressure. Thought I was going to die the entire time, of course, but it got better then aside from me growing obsessed with my health.

Fast forward to today. After stressing for a whole month that I might've gotten myself pregnant I finally started birth control on the 16th, thinking I might finally chill, but nope! Now I'm convinced I'm developing a thrombosis or something worse. I had a panic attack last week that my SO had to talk me through, thinking I was having a lung ebolism, and now suddenly my right foot, wrist, upper arm and leg hurt, I get tingles in my right little and ringfinger, and occasionally there's this burning sensation around my knee and elbow that just... make no sense whatsoever? Travels to my left side sometimes, too, and my hands are often cold.

Can someone please tell me that I'm okay? I've been to my doctor so many times this month because of different things and I'm so embarrassed to turn up there so often for little to no diagnosis. I should know my symptoms are too much over the place to be anything serious, but I just want to go through a single day again without me obsessing over every little pin &amp; needle that I'm feeling. :(",1
"Bad Tattoo Experience making me lose my mind I got a large elbow tattoo Wednesday and it's RUINED my mental since, to make a very long story short basically the tattoo artist wasn't as clean as I'd like him to be, he didn't even wash his hands before putting on his gloves and tattooing me, the needle and grip were new but the tattoo wire was not covered in plastic or the workspace. He says that he uses a very strong cleaner between every client but my mind doesnt want to accept it.

&amp;#x200B;

To make it all worse he didn't do the tattoo i even wanted, and did a fucking terrible job so now i have a huge bad tattoo with a terrible story with it and just waiting til i can lazer it off.

I can't stop thinking I could've got hiv or hepatitis c because of this, do you guys think I am being crazy? I went to my doctor and asked the opinion of many people in the tattoo and health field and they all say I'm fine but I can't stop thinking that I could've ruined my entire life and it wasn't even my fault.

"Bleeding after having bowel movement So Iâ€™m a 24y female. And every time I have a bowel movement I bleed. There wonâ€™t be blood in the stool, but when I wipe.

It feels slightly painful while in the process of defecating but after Iâ€™m ok. Now, I know this probably just anal fissures but at times I worry that it could be serious. Iâ€™ve been taking cymbalta for almost a year to help me with my health anxiety.

"Got a bloodtest, scared to hear about Leukemia. I've posted this in r/AskDocs but I just wanted to hear more. Sorry. I'm seeking as much support as I can that isn't from people close to me because I don't want to scare them too.  

I'm a 18 year old female living in Canada. 5'9, 60kg, Half Chinese Half Russian.

I have always had pretty good health for my entire life, so such a sudden change in health is scaring me to death. For the last week, my skin suddenly changed. I have never really bruised, no matter how hard I would hit my knee on something no bruise would ever appear. My family always joked about how even if I fell off a building I'd be completely fine since my skin was ""so thick.""

For the last week, I've noticed weird changes in bloodclotting. I pick at my acne sometimes (gross, I know) and it would be fine the next day; however, suddenly now when I wake up, I see a HUGE blood scab and bruising around a small white head I picked at the night before. It made me look diseased but I brushed it off as something silly.

Then my legs and arms started having weird red dots all over, paired with bruising in odd places like the middle of my thigh where I would never get hit or hurt. It isn't a rash, and my doctor appointment confirmed today that it wasn't a rash too.

Not only were my legs and arms covered in these red speckles but my chest, upper belly, and my gums were too. The days before I was surprisingly out of breath. I was out with my friend and constantly needed to sit down after a couple minutes of walking. Even in the bus, I was extremely uncomfortable with standing and would squat in the middle if there were no chairs because I could not stand to stand. My friend joked about it and so did I as I usually would walk quite fast and wanted to go everywhere. Such a sudden change left her a bit weirded out too.

I finally decided that I was freaked out enough to go in a walk-in clinic. The doctor said it MIGHT be hemophilia and sent me to get my bloodchecked. Now I'm waiting anxiously at home and can't get the thought out of my head. I know it's useless to be afraid and think about it but I've never had such a sudden health change in my life. As I'm typing this I feel strange little zaps in the joint of my right hand. I haven't really told my friends and definitely not my parents as I don't want them to worry.

All I can do is wait.

I thought to myself while daydreaming â€œcould you imagine if I hit myself in the head with thisâ€ and while in he daydream apparently my body acted this of and I hit myself in the head with the handle at itâ€™s full length. Now Iâ€™m worried that Iâ€™ll cause serious damage because my doctor gave me a pamphlet to avoid head injuries after concussions because it can cause permanent damage.

- Wait and see if symptoms resolve, then possibly book a relatively non-invasive treatment
- Book treatment now without waiting
- Have invasive colonoscopy you have no real indication of needing just to get a full medical workup and ease my anxiety

"Chiropractic adjustment on neck now scared of cervical artery dissection This will sound ridiculous and it is embarassing to even type but that is what we are all here for to get these issues out in the open and find people who can support us right so here it goes. I am a 27 y.o male and have been seeing my chiro for years because I would get headaches. He uses the drop table method and I have had my neck adjusted 100s of times before. Last week I went to my doctor for an unrelated visit and mentioned I was seeing a chiropractor. He responded right away ""dont let him touch your neck"" he told me that an older patient of his had had a stroke days after a neck adjustment because of a torn artery. Now I will mention that the chiropractor this patient had seen was using a different type of manipulation on the neck as opposed to the thompson (drop table) method. At my chiropractic appointment yesterday he did what he normally does and worked kn my back and neck. this time my neck was sore all night and I have not been able to sleep or focus on work or my kids because all I can think about is ""what if he tore something, what if I am going to have a stroke????"" seems silly right? Anyone who has health anxiety knows that these ludicrous thoughts seep into our mind and pollute our rationality and thinking. I have all but convinced myself I am going to have a stroke and die and leave my kids behind fatherless no matter how crazy I know it sounds. My neck hurts as of writing this but very mild discomfort perhaps a 2 out of 10. I would assume if you tore an artery you would feel it? Anyways I would love some responses maybe just to reassure me or if anybody has some insight on an issue like this they could share.

Now, in the past few weeks I have had 3-4 episodes where my finger would  get kinda tingly for a few minutes at most and three days ago my right hand felt tingly for 30 minutes or so; I then went to see my doctor, who thinks I have anxiety, who told me that it is almost certainly anxiety but if I keep having these symptoms for the next 15 days I can come back and he'll make me get an mri or something like that i'm not sure.
For the past three days I only felt tingling for a few seconds in my feet and I am CONSTANTLY fearing that the symptoms will come back, like I can't go 2 minutes without thinking about it.
Also since I was younger, wherever I laughed a lot( like a lot as in those cases where you laugh for minutes and almost cry ) my face goes numb/shaky or trembles and the same thing happens when I'm anxious sometimes, and especially after I am relieved.
Lastly, like 2 years ago or so my left lower back and hip felt like they were sunburnt for 3 days for no apparent reason.
I can't go on like this, I am CONSTANTLY thinking about it and expecting symptoms to show up...I don't want to die..",1
"Tips for letting things go? TLDR at end

I am 17, recently coming off a fear of 
having visual snow. I had read about it and essentially convinced myself that I had it. I am no longer anxious about that however, and I am now on a depersonalization scare. I have had HA for a few years, all over things that havenâ€™t been problems. Recently, for about a week, I have been afraid that I have depersonalization disorder. I donâ€™t have the same symptoms, and I donâ€™t truly believe I have that disorder, but sometimes when I think about it (the disorder) or when I think about the fact that something could be wrong with me, everything feels surreal for a few seconds. I have wierd thoughts where I think â€œIâ€™m actually here and doing thingsâ€. This can often happen after i have been on my phone for some time, or when I have been distracted and I snap out of it. I believe it is just snapping back to reality, and my brain has taken this and made it into a problem. Iâ€™m pretty sure everyone experiences this from time to time, but since my brain  thinks itâ€™s a problem whenever I think about it I feel that feeling. I realize it could also just be an awareness of how many things I do without really thinking about it every day, like tying my shoes, and my brain thinks that because I am not truly thinking about what I am doing I am depersonalize. In conclusion, do you guys have any tips for realizing that youâ€™re ok and letting things go? 

TLDR I have HA, feeling weird, I know nothing is wrong, how I do convince myself that Iâ€™m ok so i can forget?",1

"Ready to look into medication but anxiety began with...medication.. Help me? So my story with health anxiety, being a hypochondriac, what-have-you, actually started with medication.. 

I was using Xanax for a good while, things kind of spiraled for me and went from a â€œwhen I am having a panic attackâ€ use to a full blown addiction. Blah blah.
I think it might be important to add I ABRUPTLY kicked this addiction in a single day after being given a (clearly not RX)  Xanax, laced with something horrible, almost died, huge ER bill. The whole 9 yards. That was enough for me, was the last time I have taken so much as an ibuprofen. This was the middle of 2017. This RUINED ME. My anxiety over this one night has vastly affected the past 2 years of life, without a doubt.

Fast forward through a long time of the absolute hell of withdrawal and just pretty much (seemingly) permanent drastically increased anxiety, that didnâ€™t exist on a scale even close to this before even being put on Xanax. 
Went through a decently long period of CBT, talk therapy, lifestyle changes, etc. kicked a large amount of the anxiety. The agoraphobia, social anxiety, extreme fear of any male (lol) 


BUT, here we are, present day..... I just can NOT kick my health anxiety. 
I canâ€™t. If itâ€™s not one thing, it is another. This is an every other week thing, where I am completely obsessed with a new thing. I wonâ€™t name them all as I completely realize that can be very triggering but I am currently fixated on breast cancer. 
I donâ€™t think I can do this any longer, the constant obsession and panic and symptom analyzing, noticing every mark or spot on my body, etc. And I sure as hell know that I canâ€™t afford it either. I am going absolutely insane over all of â€œmy diseasesâ€ 

So the point is, I am ready to seek out a medication option.... But how does someone whoâ€™s anxiety has literally all stemmed from a single pill, go about this? 
What are some of your experiences? How can I convince myself to begin a medication when I canâ€™t even take a Tylenol? How do I shake the fear of another medication further screwing up my brain? 

Getting very desperate and need a little push or insight to really shake this thing. ",1

"I am doing much better! Hey guys had an awful panic attack that sent me to the ER back in August and started a whole slew of anxiety related problems and oh boy I don't wish this upon anyone. So I have had pretty much every symptom under the sun from anxiety and SSRI medication. I could barely function, work, study, I couldn't leave the house. Then the health anxiety started up and I wa sure I was dying all the time. Pain would be all over the place and move around and change the type of pain. All just anxiety. Life was brutal. But since we rarely see posts on this. I AM DOING WAY BETTER!!! I feel like my normal self and honestly feel like i am a better person I am much more compassionate, sympathetic and understanding because of my experiences. And for everyone battling anxiety, I know it can feel hopeless, but you can get better. Take things one day at a time. Just try to do 1 thing better everyday. ",1
"Concerned for Co-Worker (Vision Problems)   

Iâ€™m reaching out on behalf of a co-worker. Over the past three weeks, he has been having progressive problems with his sight. Iâ€™m not sure of all the details, but he has been to a family doctor, an optometrist, and a doctor that specializes in how the nerves relate to eye sight (not a neurologist, canâ€™t remember the name). Iâ€™m not sure of all the tests performed, but he claims to have explored just about every route possible, and no one can tell him anything! I asked him what the next step was, and he told me there were no next steps.

He is 64 years old, and has had cataracts previously, but has been fine in the six years that Iâ€™ve known him.  He wears glasses due to being farsighted.  The problems started about three weeks ago, and have progressed to the point where he canâ€™t make out anything that he canâ€™t make anything out (glasses or not) that is more than about 10-15 feet away from him. I was talking to him this morning and standing about that distance away, and he said he couldnâ€™t make out the details of my face.

From his explanation, if you take each eye and break it off into quadrants, each week he starts having problems in a new one. So, he had problems in one quadrant in his right eye three weeks ago. Then problems in another, and so on. Currently, he has blurry vision in three of four quadrants in his right eye and one of four quadrants in his left eye. Beyond this, I donâ€™t have much more info.

Does anyone have any insight as to what this could be? Or what steps he could take?

Thanks everyone!",1
"Terrified that I have Lung Cancer Hi all. 29 y/o F. Never smoked a cigarette in my life, but I have fully convinced myself that I have lung cancer and it has consumed me fully. I spend the entire day googling symptoms. I have had a weird on and off cough since September. It doesn't keep me up at night, though. It is somewhat productive with clear mucus. My breathing also feels strange, like I have to do a little cough when I exhale sometimes. I've recently noticed pain in my mid-upper back near my spine.

In December, I started having a bad pain below my shoulder blade. My PCP ordered a chest xray, which came back normal. I had a CBC in December which was normal, except for low B12, which I've been supplementing with B12 vitamins now.

"Don't know if I legitimately messed up my neck or if the stress is making it this way For the past 3 weeks, I've had stiffness and discomfort in my neck. For the first 2 weeks, I'm pretty sure it was a legitimate issue of carrying heavy bags on my shoulders while traveling. It started to feel better but then I felt the back of my neck with my hand and I noticed a hard lump where my skull meets my neck. It seems reasonable that it would be my spine but I've never felt it before now and it's close to the surface and large. It seriously freaked me out and now I can't stop messing with my neck and pushing on it. It is now stiff again and hurts. I convinced it was my own fault from messing with it and being super stressed out again. But this morning I also noticed that when I move my head side to side in a certain position, there is a crunching sound that almost sounds like sand grinding. It makes my head and neck feel almost dizzy but seriously uncomfortable. I don't know if that is real or anxiety. I'm going to the doctor on Monday but I'm afraid they won't take me seriously, but I think I may have legitimately messed something up I. my neck. I'm young and this came on rapidly so I don't know if I screwed it up from traveling or what. But I'm seriously scared since it's near my spinal cord and I will go paralyzed or have to get surgery.

"i canâ€™t tell if itâ€™s all in my head or not and itâ€™s trying me crazy New around here but Iâ€™m so glad this sub exists since I know I tend to be very aware of my health. Sorry about the length. TL;DR at the end. 

Four years ago I started to develop occasional constipation. It was nothing a little dried fruit couldnâ€™t solve and it only happened every so often. So far, so good.

Then it all started going downhill after I had a kidney stone when I was 17. Ever since then, Iâ€™ve been struggling with constipation daily. Since diet change wasnâ€™t helping I went to my momâ€™s GI doc and had my first colonoscopy at 17. Fun. The test came back clear and the GI sent me home with directions to take Miralax daily. Fast forward a year, no change. Miralax helps but it was like going from hard stool constipation to soft stool constipation. Went back to GI where I was diagnosed with IBS-C with no further testing and given a prescription of Linzess. 

Two years go by, still no change. Linzess works but not as well as it used to. Not only that, but I was now dealing with worse symptoms and felt as if my guts just werenâ€™t moving. I was still have a bowel movements almost daily, but it was never without a laxative of some sort. I tried the low-FODMAP without much change either. I did eliminate dairy and gluten from my diet (cleared a ton of my acne once I did that).

I decide to get a second opinion. Saw a different GI. He suggests a blood test and does an endoscopy. Ended up getting diagnosed with GERD and chronic gastritis. Also, he found food still in my stomach despite not eating anything 13 hours beforehand. GI sends me to get a gastric emptying study done. That test ended up turning out normal too. Blood test was also normal besides for a low % of lymphocytes and a low number for bun/creatine. Neither of those were that much lower than the â€œnormal rangeâ€.  All and all, I was given a clean bill of health.

But if these tests are coming back normal (besides the GERD and chronic gastritis) then why am I still having symptoms? Why is it getting worse over the years? It was just constipation at first which Iâ€™m sure is just affects your colon. So why am I having upper GI issues now? I constantly deal with regurgitation, constipation, nausea, cramping, slow moving bowels, gas, bloating, low grade fevers, etc. I canâ€™t even do exercise without throwing up. I used to swim varsity in high school and now I canâ€™t swim an entire 50 yards without running out of the pool. Doesnâ€™t matter when I eat or what time of day it is. 

At first, dried fruit did the trick but when things get real bad not even an enema or magnesium citrate work. But on other days they do. Why it is that when I try to talk to a doctor about it they donâ€™t listen? Is it because Iâ€™m only 20? Even my parents are sick of me constantly feeling ill, especially on vacations. Iâ€™ve been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and ADHD but wasnâ€™t given any medications until last year so I know it didnâ€™t start because of medication. 

What if it really is all in my head? What if Iâ€™m just doing this to myself by stressing over it? Iâ€™m transferring from community college to university this fall. What if I canâ€™t do it and have to go home? Whoâ€™s gonna believe me if these tests just come back normal? But I just know something is wrong. Why else would I still have these issues if everything was okay?

Iâ€™m going to a gastroenterology motility clinic at Stanford at the end of April to get one last opinion. I just feel like Iâ€™m wasting so much money. Iâ€™m probably the only person that wants a diagnoses at this point. I just want answers. But at the same time, what if the results were right and there is nothing wrong? I dunno. I just have so much anxiety now around food and eating/shitting in general. It wasnâ€™t like this last year, until things slowly started to get worse. 

TL;DR: Been having bowel/stomach issues for years. GI doctors slap on IBS diagnoses, but Iâ€™m worried itâ€™s something worse due to worsening symptoms over the years. But also worried that there really is nothing wrong and that the stress/anxiety was it all along. Stressed about wasting money on pointless tests thatâ€™ll all come back normal even though every day is a struggle. ",1

"Do you ever find your ""symptoms"" change or transfer to different areas? A couple of months ago I started getting this sharp pain in my upper right abdomen just below the ribcage. I'm 27 and regrettably eat a fair amount of takeout so naturally I assumed this to be gallbladder issues. I ended up getting it checked at the ER one night when I got some really sharp pains and found a ""bump"" in that area. The doctor was convinced the bump was just fatty cartilage and since the pains seemed to happen at random and not after meals that it was likely not my gallbladder. They scheduled an ultrasound anyway which turned up with no issues which I was happy about.

&amp;#x200B;

That said since then I started getting neck/back pain, which didn't really concern me given my crappy posture and I've always had a fair amount of neck tension. However in the past couple weeks I started getting random shoulder/arm pains that come just as quick as they go, and today i started getting quick sharp chest pains, though I'm convinced the chest issue comes from some recreational smoking last night with some friends.

"Hand cramps and twitching - ALS? My left hand has been pretty sore for 3 or so days. 

Basically the thumb is â€œcramping upâ€ when I use my phone or type. 

Itâ€™s in my left hand, I feel a little bit of the same thing in my right hand though not nearly as bad. 

The cramp isnâ€™t normally at rest. It usually begins quickly after using my phone or typing. My dominant hand is right. 

I donâ€™t type a whole lot at work. 

Iâ€™ve had twitching randomly all over my body, face, chin, jaw, calves, quads, glutes, forearms, ankles, biceps, triceps, shoulders. Which has left me absolutely terrified of ALS.  This has been happening for 3 weeks. My PCP ruled out electrolytes as the cause through a blood test. Magnesium is in line as well. 

White Male, 24yo, 6â€™00â€ 185lbs

PCP tested reflex, said 99% sure itâ€™s nothing but ordered an EMG if I wanted and I said sure. I was anxious. Thursday the hand pain started after the PCP visit. I now have it in right hand a bit (was just using my phone with thumb). Some forearm soreness was there earlier. 

Iâ€™m in good shape athletic and pretty strong and have no obvious clinical weakness. 

hands generally alright at rest. The iphone and the keyboard aggravate it

The twitching started before anything else.  

And really, I havenâ€™t noticed any twitching my hands. Maybe once or twice, but generally itâ€™s in the arms, legs. Including back, shoulders, forearm, bicep, tricep, abdomen, calf, quad, glute, hamstring

"How to cope with panic attacks triggered by health anxiety? I can't stop worrying about something that probably isn't a big deal. I can't calm myself down, I'm freaking out and I'm all alone and everyone I know is busy, so I can't call them.

I found a spot on my body that hurts to touch and afterwards an area near it started to feel strained (without having to be touched). I Googled it but can't find anything that matches closely with what I'm experiencing and somehow that makes me feel worse. I'm jittery right now and nauseous from the anxiety, but also I'm worried that that's related to whatever problem I just found on my body.

"How to help my husband Hi there! I am a 28 YO F married to my incredible 37 YO M husband who suffers from health anxiety. It comes in waves. He has gone through some therapy but she wasnâ€™t a LMHC so it was kind of pointless. He is on a low dose SSRI and that usually helps. Until we see someone who has MS. 
Oddly enough, my maternal grandmother had MS. He does not have any history of it in his family. He does not know his paternal grandfather and sometimes that is his excuse for why he thinks MS might run in his family. Anyway, we saw a friend who was recently diagnosed with MS over the weekend and his anxiety has been through the roof. I have severe anxiety and OCD, so sometimes I spiral once heâ€™s spiraling, but usually I can keep my cool. 
I am trying to find a way to help him. He has no real symptoms, but has some issues that lead to similar symptoms. For example, heâ€™s a graphic design teacher with metal screws in his wrist, so he frequently gets odd sensations in his hands from working on computers all day, but of course thatâ€™s the MS - not the likely carpal tunnel or arthritis he has going on. 
Any suggestions? He is open to therapy but I donâ€™t know that he will stick to it since the episodes are so few and far between. What can I do to help?",1
"Low pulse rate - Could 1.5 weeks of exercise result in lowered atenolol dosage? I have been taking 100 mg atenolol daily for quite some time now (several years). I was prescribed it for an elevated testing heart rate of about 90 to 100. No history of heart problem, negative stress test. The atenolol seemed to be doing it's job as my resting heart rate fell to about 70 bpm. Fast forward about 1.5 weeks ago I changed my diet and started walking about 3 miles every day (90 minutes). Today I notice that my resting heart rate is 50 bpm. I would not think the exercise could improve my heart rate that quickly, but could it?

"Afraid something is extremely wrong with my heart Hey guys. 

I lost my job in March due to Gastritis from unknown causes. Had an endoscopy and biopsies. It's just gastritis and they think it may be due to my gallbladder but I will be having tests for that in about a week. I have been extremely ill with that since the beginning of January. Lost almost 20 lbs. In pain all day. It's great. 
ANYWAY, throughout this time and I *think* right before (but only rarely) I have been having having issues when I stand and start doing usual activities. My heart rate soars when I stand and when I begin doing everyday things, nothing strenuous, I even get sweaty sometimes and short of breath. This scares me so I have to lay back down and then it immediately goes back to normal. 
I have a history of PVCs, the palpitation where your heart skips a beat. I saw a cardiologist and he did not see anything and said it was ""pretty good"" except he vaguely mentioned some part of the ultrasound being ""slower"" and he told me to exercise more. He didn't explain any of that. That was a year ago now. 
I realize I have been laying on the couch for about a month now, but could that cause all this? I also often have low blood pressure but I've never had this happen everyday. Could it be any of these causes or maybe since I haven't been able to eat much anymore? 
My anxiety is driving me insane. Someone please help. ;(((

"I recently remembered multiple sclerosis exists A few weeks ago I felt a weird pulsating sharp pain in the back of my head, I promised myself I wouldn't google it but by the end of the day I just couldn't let go. So I googled it and worried for days I had occipital neuralgia but it went away and then I remember the next suggested disease: multiple sclerosis.  
And now I just conviced myself all the weird symptoms I had and went to the doctor only to be told I'm completely fine must be because of MS. 

Like the times I thought I was having a heart attack because of pain in my left arm, or when I thought I had a detached retina because my eyes ""felt weird"" and I thought I saw flashing lights. When I focus on something really close to my eyes and then focus on something far and feel a little desoriented etc etc etc. It must all be neurological after all!

And now I feel all these things again and I keep thinking what if it isn't psychosomatic. On top of it, I'm going to be without insurance for a few months while I'm in between jobs and neurologists and MRIs are just waay to expensive.

"Anaphylaxis fear This is probably the most ridiculous manifestation of my health anxiety yet. I've basically developed an anaphylaxis fear, mostly related to food, even though I've never had a food-related reaction in my life.

This has made eating pretty much anything an incredibly stressful experience. Eating is one of my favourite things to do, especially trying new food and anxiety is even affecting that now.

Does anyone have any advice? Or even some statistics that could perhaps put my mind at ease? I am worried this will turn into a full-blown eating disorder in which I only eat limited quantities of what I consider safe foods.",1

"I'm relapsing on my past HA, at least right now. [Long post] In October of 2017, I had my first actual panic attack and it was massive. I never figured out where it came from, but I ended up in the ER for fear of a heart attack. Had all the symptoms just about. This occurred about 2-3 more times within a week or two and it got to the point that the doctor got frustrated and told me I was wasting the ERs time and money on potential people who may actually need it and gave me a low amount of Xanax and a referral for a therapist. After then, I had lingering chest pains for seemingly 24/7, so I also went to a cardiologist and did several tests from ecgs/EKGs to wearing a heart monitor for varying times, with one month being the longest. Turns out my heart was 100% healthy and the healthiest he had seen in years, which was surprising considering I was a smoker and drank too much caffeine and drank a bit too much. I still smoke, drink caffeine and drink here and there but I've cut down tremendously since. I was in therapy for 6 months. It mostly involved us talking things through, but we also got to a point where I would try to purposely induce attacks so we could with through them together in order to learn how I can tackle them by myself. Another thing we did that helped was write down my current health fears (biggest one was fearing a brain aneurysm would come at any time because of my constant headaches and ice pick headaches) and I would also write why it was making me scared. Then I would come back for my next visit two weeks later and she'd have me read what I wrote and it always sounded insane but never ever for me to stop being worried entirely, but overtime it got better. I was diagnosed with hypochondria/health illness anxiety. I have since moved to California after being in therapy for 6 months. For whatever reason, it was like a complete 180, from worrying about it all the time to not worrying about it much at all anymore. I would still get some attacks here and there but I always managed them one way or another.

Lately, I've just been more down than usual and I plan on seeing another therapist to try and tackle that, but I think it's partially making the hypochondriac I am come back out. Example: about two nights ago, I was getting ready to take a nap, but I was on my phone for a few, getting settled, propping myself with my right hand/arm on my side. Later, I would wake up and I started gaming a bit after, but I noticed my upper right arm and lower shoulder have sharp pains after moving it a few certain ways. I brushed it off because I figured, ""I probably put too much strain on it when I was on my side before my nap"". Well it's been a few nights now or so and while it hasn't gotten worse, it hasn't gotten better, I think. Fine, whatever. But then I noticed pains in my forearm, closer to my wrist that would come and go slightly. Then I started feeling that later in my right forearm. Today I was pulling weeds and when I got back up, my shins had sharp pains for a few minutes. I was feeling off and light-headed and thought I may be dehydrated because I drank last night and didn't really do a good job keeping myself hydrated then. So I did the worst thing possible - I googled dehydration symptoms. When it becomes ""severe"" and should seek help, etc. Granted this was just all on the same page, but I didn't have to read it. I legit just wasn't sure if it was dehydration and it did more hurt than it helped. I'm feeling better after some water, but now while I'm not constantly Googling anything on the exception to see what the symptoms of dehydration were and effects it could have on the body, I'm fighting that feeling of being worried about the pains I mentioned above. If it was just the shoulder pain, or just the here and there forearm pain or the mild discomfort I feel in my fingers... basically if I just wasn't feeling pain in varying intensities and one or two areas, I could easily reason with myself.

I haven't seen my doctor in a couple months and I'm going to make an appointment in the morning and talk with her about it and see what we can do, as well as probably set up to see another therapist for what I'm assuming to be depression. But I'm feeling myself slipping again and I'm not ready to deal with even a fraction of what I dealt with before.",1
"Dizzy after coughing spells...is this normal? For the last week, I've been battling a cold. It's mostly been a normal cold, except for one thing.

"Does anyone get anxious that theyâ€™re just making it all up? How do you cope? Iâ€™m experiencing some legit health problems in my life right now, but I canâ€™t shake the feeling of â€œIâ€™m just a faker, what if I have a somatic disorder, what if I have Munchausens, Iâ€™m an attention seeker, etc etc.â€ which is fucked up, because I would give anything to feel better right now! Obviously I donâ€™t have Munchausens, because I wish that I was not sick. 


Itâ€™s sort of ironic, having a legitimate health issue, and being so anxious that you convince yourself you are faking it and get scared that you have a mental disorder that makes people fake health issues.

Does anyone else experience this self doubt when experiencing actual illness/health issues?

"Tired of dealing with this Iâ€™m 17 yr female Iâ€™m pretty slim and small, and Iâ€™ve noticed Iâ€™ve had a fast heart rate for a long while now but lately itâ€™s gotten bad. Three months ago, all of a sudden felt dizzy, my heart was racing so I went to the doctor and they took blood work which came out normal and sent me to a cardiologist. Iâ€™m guessing it was my first panic attack? My ekg was normal, he said he heard a heart murmur but thought I was okay and i had anxiety. He didnâ€™t even feel the need to check my heart. But I still did a 48 hour heart monitor, didnâ€™t really feel any symptoms, but  it was still normal, he just said I had sinus tachycardia. This was a about a month or 2 ago and it feels like now everything has gotten worse. My heart rate is always 100+ and when Iâ€™m walking or stand up itâ€™s 140+ sometimes. I was also walking to class upstairs and I was gasping for air and my heart was racing.  The highest my heart Iâ€™ve seen my heart go is 195 which doesnâ€™t sound healthy. My heart rate will also go from 50 to 100 randomly which concerns me? Yesterday morning I woke up with my heart rate at 170 so I went to the ER and my ekg was normal.

"Concussion anxiety taking over my life Let me just preface this by saying I've been essentially the hugest hypochondriac my entire life, even to the point of freaking out over a bat *maybe* biting me after it flew over my head once. I've never been this anxious about anything because getting a life threatening TBI is my hugest fear and it's basically consumed me.

Almost two full days ago, I slammed my head four times within two or so hours against a few different walls. Not ruthlessly hard, but *just* hard enough to worry. I matched basically no concussion symptoms at the time but it hasn't stopped me from flipping out excessively. Since I woke up yesterday though, I've gotten minor potential symptoms that made it so I couldn't function in my normal life without freaking out, which has worried me. While I didn't get a headache, I had minor, non-painful, yet strange feeling head pressure, (especially when moving it,) slight sensitivity to light, occasionally feeling dazed, me not being able to remember or place words in sentences, etc. It became rough trying to figure out which 'symptoms' were from me freaking myself out, and which could be potentially real. I even stopped drinking coffee because I'm so freaked out caffeine could make my 'concussion' worse.

The worst part came last night, when I dozed off while hanging out with friends watching a movie around 8. *I couldn't sleep.* I kept jerking myself awake and my body refused to do anything, heart racing, and it got to the point I kept taking 20 hour power naps until midnight where I'd wake up in a total daze with some of the worst anxiety I've had in my life. So, reasonably, I Googled symptoms to subdermal hematomas, which freaked me out even *more,* because now I'm convinced I have a brain bleed. I woke up this morning and I still feel dazed, still shaking, even though the only remaining concussion symptom is me feeling pretty dumb and detached from the world. Even *after* friends who've had real concussions reassured me, nothing's helped, in fact me Googling shit made it worse (like always.) 

I guess my rant results to me asking whether or not I'm justified being like this. I've been honest to God debating on just driving to an ER or something immediately despite potential freakout and the fact I'm only 18 because almost nothing else has entered my mind. The anxiety has been consuming me, and I'm 100% convinced I'm dying, and it's the *worst.*",1
"Hello, I could use advice...I am suffering from rather severe health anxiety. (At least I think I am?) Hello, I just want to say I'm really sorry if I break any of the rules! I am a bit confused as to what is allowed ;; I don't know if there is a point to this, I am just...confused and scared.

I am 15, and for the past years I have experienced extreme fatigue, to the point where I sleep ~15+ hours a day when I can. But how do I know if this is real? I could just have a bad lifestyle. I try my best to stay healthy and do everything the doctor says, but it doesn't go away. 

I also believe I could be ""faking"" it? I experience a lot of weakness and like...memory problems. I also get chronic pain in my thigh which is really painful.

"Chest pains earlier today. Scared to go to sleep. Hi all. I'm new to this subreddit and so glad I found it.

"I'm a lot scared about my mom's lower leg pain Hi! First of all, I made a second account to talk about these personal issues, I use my personal account (which has my real name) for a lot of public things and didn't feel comfortable in sharing those personal issues there.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom had breast cancer six years ago, and treated it successfully, doing chemo and radiotherapy. Fortunately, it was diagnosed very early. She is totally cured now, and constantly monitors her breast and

 thyroid (which she had some benign cysts). She is 60 and doesn't smoke or drink at all.

&amp;#x200B;

Last week, she removed a dot on her face. The biopsy returned Basal Cell Carcinoma, but with no spread on close lymphs. The dermatologist said it was nothing to worry about.

&amp;#x200B;

But yesterday she said she had been felling pain around the tibia for about a year and half. It's a pain she feels deep, that comes for some time (like a week), then disappear for some months, then comes back. It doesn't seem to be affected by exercise, but hurts at night. While she was pressing the region to show me where it was, she said she could feel it hurt a little, even if, at that moment, it wasn't hurting the way it used to. There is no swelling at all, and she said it never was. She also said the pain is the same since it begun. 

&amp;#x200B;

And she had been having some cramps a while ago, the doctors said it could be a neuropaty caused by the medications she took, like tamoxifen. She also said these cramps usually stops when this pain begins.

&amp;#x200B;

She said she's worried about it being a bone metastasis from the breast cancer.

&amp;#x200B;

From what I know, it's extremely unlikely that a metastasis from a cancer she treated back in 2013 (and which, in that time, had no secondary tumor detected) could only appear now. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I'm extremely worried about other cancer possibilities. Like a primary bone cancer, or a secondary cancer from a hidden tumor that originated in other part of the body.

&amp;#x200B;

The rational part of me says it's probably neuropaty, or even some other symptom caused maybe by her age, and if that pain was bone cancer, she probably would be gone now, or at least the pain would have gotten worse after all this time, or even some swelling would have appeared.

&amp;#x200B;

But the other part (the same that worried about me having ALS because of some twitches) says it could be cancer. She has an appointment with the same doctor that treated her cancer on Monday, but, until then, I can't help but be terrified about this possibility.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone had any similar experience? Is the rational part of me probably right once again?",1
One tonsil swollen? Has this happened to anyone else? I'm just now getting over a bout of a really bad sore throat I had for a couple of weeks. I had significant post nasal drip at the time too. I went to the doctor and she said it wasn't strep and she figured it was just an upper respiratory infection and that it just looked like swelling from irritation. My sore throat is mostly gone but the tonsil in question still appears to be swollen or have a lump behind it. I know that it's probably just because of the illness but I'm worried and I don't have health insurance and it's very hard to see a doctor without it here. I don't want to go back and them tell me it's nothing. Has this happened to anyone else? I'm 24 F and i used to be a smoker but I've quit for about 7 months now,1
"my urine is clear for no reason for like a week now my pee has been barely yellow to almost clear even if i hadnâ€™t really had anything to drink during the day. thereâ€™s no pain, smell, or excessive amounts, itâ€™s just the color. i know this is probably nothing to worry about, but my anxiety is worrying me that it might be something bad, and i just went to the doctor so i donâ€™t want to go again ",1
"Scared my doc won't take me seriously Hi all, I'm a new here, I've had health anxiety for about 6 years, it comes and goes a couple of times a year for me but when I have an episode it's BAD, I'm talking like exacerbating my own physical symptoms by worrying, googling for hours until I'm convinced I'm going to die, hell even obsessing over my pets health and running them to the vets for every tiny thing, although that mostly started after my old kitty died of lymphoma.

Anyway so I'm really worried about going to the doctor next week that she's not going to take me seriously if I tell her I have health anxiety.  I think that I have PGAD, although granted my anxiety does seem to be making it way worse, I do have actual symptoms and reason to believe it.  I'm actually just kind of hoping it's all in my head but at the same time I'm worried that if I don't get tested and assessed for it it will turn out to be real and not just my anxiety ðŸ˜­ I hate that feeling of uncertainty ðŸ˜­",1
"Anyone get nervous about getting the flu when they go to the doctor? Today I had to go to the doctor and a man was sitting near me coughing a lot. After the game out of his appointment he was wearing a mask, which implies to me that they figured he had the flu or something similar. Now Iâ€™m freaking out about getting the flu. Anyone else get this?",1
"I'm Sacred But I Think I'm Also Broken. Every Few Months my pee starts to smell sweet and I have to urinate more frequently and I get tired, for example I've urinated 3 times in the past hour today which isn't normal for me usually I urinate 3-4 times a day, at first I thought it was Diabetes or something else but I've had many blood tests etc done and they all came back normal. 

Last time this happen it lasted from July 2018 - November 2018, I had numerous tests and numerous Doctors say it was a Viral Infection.

It seems to happen every few months, I consume a normal amount of Sugar, I only drink water I drink about 1-2 litres a day, I walk alot.

The Doctors can't figure out the issue, posting here just incase someone has had the same issues as me.

"Recurring chest pain with no other symptoms Iâ€™ve had a lot of intense stress the past year and also suffer from an anxiety disorder, so it seems to be affecting my body a lot. I went to the ER back in February because my chest hurt and I had a lot of coughing, and they did a chest x-ray and CT scan and monitored my heart rate, and everything came back clean for heart issues with reassurance from the radiologist that Iâ€™m very low risk for heart issues. I was diagnosed with pleurisy which was verified by my regular doctor, and got better after a couple weeks. The chest pain has seemed to linger though and my stress has not improved. I have no other symptoms with this chest pain other than anxiety that itâ€™s something bad. Iâ€™m afraid to waste more money going to the hospital again since they ran tests that came back clean. Could this be something I need to have checked out again? ",1
"[Trigger warning] I'm 17, I have MS, and I'm worried I also have colon cancer. It's been quite the rough year and I'll admit my HA wasn't as bad as it was after my family got the results from my first MRI test. Sure, I googled symptoms all the time, especially because one of my ""enflamed lesions"" was causing me chronic nausea for more than a month, leading me to finally start on my google journey again and begin to go down the rabbit hole of different problems I could possibly have. Until I got double vision, I was almost convinced I had esophagus cancer. 

It was crazy. I googled stuff all the time, cried over things I might have, worried about it till I fell asleep. But I never really expected the new thing called ""MS"" i saw in passing was actually going to end up being me. It was crazy. Every single part. And as you can already expect, it's fueling even more, even worse anxiety as I try to figure out some current bowel problems that have been plaguing me since my diagnosis last year. Today I made it a job for me to find out what is going on. I've made my way up to taking 290 mg of Linzess a day and still deal with constipation unless I decide to have a fun day out. I always have to go to the bathroom anyway, throughout the day, whether or not I actually end up going. I started having lower right, dull pain halfway into my newfound constipation and was told the linzess would help. It didn't. Then we decided to try more. It helped for a week. I'm vaguely aware or trying to convince myself that drinking more water should help, because I'm supposed to with linzess or i risk becoming dehydrated, but its been hard to keep up with. 

TMI but, because I'm nervous and desire opinions, I must go on. My stools are pale and light a lot of the time. Yellow or white mucus covers some of it and half of it floats, half doesn't... Most times I go I bleed a little after, and this past time, quite a lot. A bright red glop of blood which just didn't seem right for what could've been a hemorrhoid or something else.  I usually always feel some kind of discomfort or dull pain in my abdomen, across the lower side usually, and  recently I even had a blood test taken that said my blood count was low. This may be because, for MS reasons, I'm trying to cut down on red meats and aren't getting enough iron... But it doesn't seem right. At all. All these symptoms line up. down to the anemia. I'm worried beyond compare of anything else before. Nothing from anyone helps, because they're just repeating their words before my MRI. I'm scared. I already panicked and cried, and called mom, and I'm going to tell my neurologist tomorrow to see what she has to offer in guidance. I can only hope I'm not this unlucky... getting two incredibly rare health problems for my age and form and everything else in the same damn year, even. 

I just don't even know where to start at dealing with this.",1
"Hypertensive at 25 &amp; fear of death Hi all! Having an HA episode today and I don't know how to cope. 

Went to my psychiatrist this morning where he took my blood pressure. He had to take it about three times- the numbers were in the 160/110 range. I was very nervous at this appt- my first time with a psychiatrist- but I've had high BP before at other doctor visits in the past month (ie i just got a CPAP machine last month- sleep doc said BP might come down with that treatment. and gyno reduced my birth control last month in an attempt to bring it down as well.) 

But today I took my BP again at CVS about 30 mins later and it was still high, so I went to urgent care. They said it was probably stress related though I can take other measures to reduce it- mostly, exercise more, lose weight, and reduce salt intake. They released me with no meds and an order to monitor it at home for white coat syndrome. 

Suddenly I'm terrified. I can make those lifestyle changes without issue. But what if they don't help? What if I go into cardiac arrest or stroke before I can lower it? Will exercise make it worse? Will I die in my sleep? Will I have to go on hypertension meds at 25? It runs in my family but this feels like a personal failing- my lifestyle and eating habits haven't helped, I'm sure. Am I fucked for life? Am I going to die young?

Im home now and just took it again; 160/90. I'm so scared. 

I have depression and GED which also don't help. I've been stressed out lately but I didn't think it was a huge problem. I feel like I'm just waiting to stroke out or go into extreme chest pain. I feel helpless. ",1

"Constantly feeling like I'm dying? I've gone to the ER so many times thinking I was dying of a heart attack when it was just terrible anxiety/panic attacks. I feel literally every bodily sensation and it puts me into a panic frenzy and makes me feel like it's my last couple of seconds on earth. I cannot handle this anymore. Is there anyway to stop this from happening? I've freaked myself out by feeling my seat-belt and even shirt touch my chest, etc. ",1
"Paranoid about food poisoning Never had it. Always terrified of it. Forever burning my chicken/avoiding eating it all together so I don't have to even worry about Salmonella killing me every time.

"Skin crawling/tickling Iâ€™ve had this sensation all over my body for the past couple months. I feel it most in my back or legs but have felt it everywhere, even on the tip of my nose. Has anyone else had this sensation before? Iâ€™m so anxious its a neurological issue or something bad.",1
"It finally got the best of me I have suffered with health anxiety over the past year but itâ€™s been increasingly worse the past few months. This along with the stress I have been under lately has been a disastrous combination. My heart rate has been higher than usual lately along with this weird pain in chest and shoulder,obviously leading me to constantly believe Iâ€™m having a heart attack. Also Iâ€™ve been somewhat struggling with more intense allergy symptoms. 
I donâ€™t have health insurance so Iâ€™ve been trying to just ignore it and chalk it up to stress but of course my mind wonders and then I go to google. The past month alone Iâ€™ve convinced myself that I have various heart issues, brain tumors, ALS and so many more. 
So, long story short, yesterday it got the best of me and I had a panic attack and went to urgent care. The nurse practitioner has pretty much decided itâ€™s all stress related but decided to do an EKG and a few blood tests anyway. The EKG came back fine and he says by the look of things I seem pretty healthy. Unfortunately the blood test result wonâ€™t be in until Saturday so thatâ€™s weighing on me because Iâ€™m obviously thinking the worst but he prescribed me some anxiety meds and they have helped slightly. 
But it still sucks to be such a prisoner in my own mind. ",1
Food went down the wrong hole. Iâ€™m panicking right now. A few hours ago I was eating a sandwich and I think I swallowed some through my wind pipe. I choked for a few seconds and drank some water and thought I was okay but Iâ€™m feeling some discomfort in my chest an it feels like something is stuck in my upper chest.

"The dread of thinking you have cancer... again My health anxiety has been okay for the last year or so but it's become out of control in the last few days. My poor husband keeps trying to reassure me but I'm struggling to keep myself together ðŸ˜”

Firstly, I've had two cold sores in the last month. That's kind of strange as usually I have an outbreak once a year, maybe twice.

Then about a week ago I developed a really sudden intense pain on the left side underneath my rib towards the back. I've never had a pain like that before and wasn't sure why it was happening. Luckily it went away after a few hours.

I've also been waking up a few nights lately sweating a little (that always starts alarm bells in my mind but I told myself it's probably because I was due for my period)

Then last night, I woke up with a really sore throat. I instantly got kind of nervous - especially combined with the two cold sores recently. I've felt kinda warm all day but in the last few hours, I feel like I'm freezing and think I might be getting a fever - which never happens to me during a cold ðŸ˜–ðŸ˜–ðŸ˜–

So ofc now I'm freaking out wondering if my immune system is destroyed because of Leukemia or Lymphoma. I'm trying to be calm but it's really difficult atm ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜” I'm hoping all this has been influenced by how stressed I've been for the last year but I'm still really scared. Any words of advice/support would be incredibly appreciated rn. ",1
"Okay, I can't live like this. How do I get help? I've had health anxiety since I can remember, I was like probably 6 or 7 when I had my first flare up but this last year it is off the charts. I actually have had some health scares and I think it's triggering it beyond belief. I think it's actually causing the aches and pains. I'm at the point where I'm 500% sure I have colon cancer and ALS and cervix/ovarian cancer and an undiagnosed heart issue. Now my kidneys hurt? So naturally my cancer has spread. It's been like this for a year, and my only relief has been when seasonal depression hits.

I'm getting married soon. I have a good job. I have lots to look forward to but I'm so so sure I won't be around to see it. I need help and no one takes me seriously. My doctor doesn't understand that this iya ruining my life and keeps giving me meds. With side effects. To someone with health anxiety. I've taken like six different types and none help at all. I can only afford 4 sessions of therapy per year and have found them mostly useless.

There has to be something. I can do. I'm so sure I'm going to die and I'm fucking terrified.",1
"Convinced I have MRI contrast dye poisoning weeks after a brain MRI. Need help coping. Using a somewhat new throwaway account, sorry if my karma is low. I'm sort of new to the realization that I have HA, but it all makes sense now. I've always had anxiety, but it's definitely evolved into this about 6 months ago.

A few months back, I had some strange symptoms that were related to jaw pain. I've pretty much figured out what's wrong there, but because of that, I've seen a slew of doctors including a neurologist. My doctor ordered a brain MRI with contrast just to be safe. I stupidly googled if the contrast dye can cause adverse reactions in people (I strongly suggest you don't google it.) Anyway, after the MRI, I felt nauseated, which set my HA into a tailspin. 

Now, a few weeks later, I'm noticing that my feet, hands, and legs suddenly go cold, especially when I'm sitting down. I'm talking freezing cold, even if the rest of my body is warm. When they finally warm up, I get pins and needles all down my legs and today, I woke up with muscle spasms in my feet and legs. My scumbag brain is telling me I have some type of weird contrast dye poisoning that isn't curable, you know how it goes.

My feet getting freezing cold does happen when I'm not in what I would say would be a heightened state of anxiety. It usually sends me into a state of anxiety which I'm sure definitely doesn't help my extremities. It's a real chicken/egg scenario.

Does this sound like anxiety to anyone or should I actually be concerned? I mean, I'm young (just turned 30,) I exercise about 4 or 5 times a week, I eat pretty healthy, and am all around healthy. In my mind, this should not be happening, but, here I am. I'm also worried that if I go to the doctor and ask him to test to see if I still have the dye in my system, he's going to think I'm crying wolf and won't take me seriously when something else is wrong.

I definitely need the sage advice of other HA veterans. I'm new to this and don't know how to tell my brain to stop worrying about it. It won't, and I feel out of control, like I can't shut it off.",1
"Constant headache: how worried should I be? Every day I have some kind of headache. I wake up, do my thing, go to work, and there it is. Some days it comes with nausea. I've been with this for 3 weeks now.

1. Most of the time it's not a full blown migraine. Those, I take sumatriptan for (and then I lie down and fall asleep for like 9 hours)

2. I'm drinking more water. I do usually have a cup of coffee with cream and sugar in the morning, but the headache starts before I have coffee.

3. I do regularly spend a lot of time in front of computer devices. I work on a computer at work, and my favorite passtimes are MMOs and other video games.

4. I've got some hot garbage vision, but I wear my glasses all the time.

5. The pain.... roams? that's the best way to explain it. It doesn't just sit in one location. Sometimes its behind my eye (either eye). Sometimes it's on my temple. Sometimes it's at the back of my head, or the top.

I have really bad anxiety about actually going to the doctor or the hospital. Hospitals freak me out and I worry that if I go to the doctor they'll send me there. .... I also have a $20 copay for each visit, and a $100 copay if I go to the hospital. ",1

Been having lots of health anxiety lately about cancer. So I had this hard palate lump behind of my front teeth it's been there for 5 years it grew same time as my 4 wisdome teeth I was wonder could it be a impacted canine? Like a tooth grow inside my hard palate? When I push my upper lip like bellow my nose i can feel it poking out. Although I had blood work done in about 5 months ago my doctors said I'm health i had no cancer and my thyroid are good and other blood related check up are also came out normal,1
"Anyone else? (HARD thump from the heart) As for a little back story, Iâ€™m 22, and I used to smoke weed all the time. Long story short, I got home from work one day about half a year ago, smoked what I then considered a normal amount of weed, and then was watching videos when I basically had a panic attack (racing heart, thinking Iâ€™m going to die, the works)
This was especially confusing because of the fact that nothing had changed or differed from my usual schedule. I had no reason to have anxiety over anything, and was in a happy place mentally, but, whatever. Anxiety.
It got to the point where I felt that way more and more, to the point that I started to feel my heart rhythm go crazy all the time, which then led to me visiting a cardiologist. They did every test imaginable and everything came back perfect, with the doc lightly suggesting I exercise a little more, but itâ€™s not super necessary. He said it was anxiety related and that I didnâ€™t need any meds, but prescribed me a blood thinner to take if my heart were to ever go absolutely crazy again. I never did take them, and it ultimately got better. I now do think it was me just tripping out in my mind.
So fast forward and I have a different issue. During my stint of heart related anxiety, one symptom I got towards the end (the worst of all) was when I would lay down at night, or be any bit more tired than usual, my heart would THUD extremely hard. It started with the occasional thud by itself, and as the days went on it became 2 thuds, 3 thuds, 4 thuds, all about 10 seconds apart from each other, increasing in force. It felt as if my heart rhythm would be thrown off, and then this thud came out of nowhere, and it was SUCH a forceful punch of a feeling that it scared the hell out of me. I was a cigarette smoker at the time, and completely stopped. I also stopped drinking even occasionally, as these things are known to increase the chance of palpitations. It got to the point where I would even get these thuds when I just woke up, and right before I went to sleep, and they seemed to be triggered when I laid down, or bent over to tie my shoe or whatever the case may be. I considered the fact that my cardiologist said my heart was fine so I just tried not to think about it.
It stopped eventually, for about 2 months. Now theyâ€™re back. In the last 2 weeks, this has occurred 3 nights now. Iâ€™ve also noticed that a flutter (thud of the same kind but to a much lesser degree) happens when I take a deep breath sometimes, not always. Again, when Iâ€™m tired. Iâ€™m wondering if this is worth another trip to the cardiologist, or if this is something others have experienced and gotten past themselves. I donâ€™t have health insurance so I donâ€™t want to go spend upwards of 1000 dollars to be told theyâ€™re benign, although they feel like my heart will explode when they happen. Does this sound familiar to anyone?",1
"I donâ€™t know what to do This is long Iâ€™m sorry. 

Symptoms started in January, just feeling off, super tired, nauseous, headaches almost everyday, always feel as if Iâ€™m about to get sick (hot throat, run down, feeling like lymph nodes were swollen, etc). At this time I was attempting to recover from binge eating disorder and going through a bout of seasonal depression, and my doctor said itâ€™s the depression making me feel all this. Prescribed me Zoloft, which I took for two weeks and stopped because the headaches I got everyday were unimaginable. 

The feeling of something being off physically never goes away. Start to feel a constant ache in my ears down the side of my neck and under my jaw. I mean literally every second of everyday. Still frequent headaches. Still feel lymph nodes are swollen. Wake up one morning at the end of March and my throat feels worse than it has in 10 years. Go to medexpress and I have strep. I thought maybe thatâ€™s what itâ€™s been all this time?! Antibiotics work after a few days on the throat but all other symptoms remain. 

Between February and March I went to an ENT who basically dismissed me and said I have TMJ, looked in my ears which he said looked perfectly healthy. So then I go to my dentist and he took an x ray of my entire head showing all jaw joints, which are normal. No sign of grinding. Looked confused when I told him right in the morning when I wake up is when I feel the best, then it gets worse throughout the day. Still gave me a mouth guard to wear at night but makes no difference. 

If I was in constant anxiety over this I would chalk it up to that but Iâ€™m really not. My CBC, diff, platelets, and all my chemistries were all normal, so that helps a lot. Iâ€™m just so tired of feeling this way. Constant headaches and nausea, with a weird ache/pressure/sensation (not painful or tender) in my ears, down my neck, under my jaw, with pain in my shoulders and the back of my neck sometimes. Some tinges of chest pains here and there.

"Just so scary. So, Iâ€™ve had health anxiety for most of my life. Like over 30 years. I am a nurse. It was easy to go into healthcare because Id spent so much of my life researching different diseases I was sure I had, or thought I had a good chance of getting, or someone I knew I had. I used to really obsessively research stuff, it somehow made me feel better. Anyway. Now, Iâ€™m a nurse. I just finished a 4 day stretch of shifts (14 hours a day, no time for meal breaks or any rest at all during work) and I only had time to sleep about 6 hours between shifts. So, I know rationally that my body and mind are exhausted and that exacerbates the health anxiety. But I woke this morning and every single muscle in my legs and back hurt so bad I can hardly walk. My hands are clammy and cold and sweaty (this never happens). I keep swinging between feeling really hot and then getting really chilled. I also have severe emetophobia and Iâ€™m terrified Iâ€™m coming down with something. My tummy feels weird like I need to poop but I canâ€™t. I canâ€™t stand the thought of food. My throat hurts.

"I have a rabies fear, can anyone help out? This all started last June, I was playing with my dog in my yard. He lunges forward and I reached out with my hand and his tooth scraped my middle finger. It did cut the skin and I was bleeding. My finger was tingling at the site where he bit me. I went to go wash it off and didnâ€™t think much of it until I looked on the fridge and I see my dog was a week overdue on his rabies vaccine. I panicked and wasnâ€™t sure what I should do. I know of rabies, but I didnâ€™t KNOW rabies until my dumb mind did some googling. 

If you know where the googling is going, then you understand my fear. If you donâ€™t, just donâ€™t worry about it. 

My dog at the time is a 13 year old German Shepherd. He is prone to seizures and would have a couple of them a year. Weâ€™ve had him for 11 years so we know how to handle the situation. He also drooled and foamed a lot in the mouth. That was his natural way. Heâ€™s been vaccinated every year as it is required in the state of New Mexico. 

I did go to urgent care and received a Tetanus shot since I was overdue on that one but my doctor told me that itâ€™s been over 40 years since a dog had rabies in my area. so I did not receive the rabies shots. Which made me feel better honestly. For about 5 months. 

In October, my dog was put down because he was struggling to stand up and seemed like he was in pain a lot. 

In late November, I got what seemed like a week long cold. Sore throat, tired, drained and all that junk. I was sick but not terrible so I went to a concert and I started to feel worse. For some dumb reason, the first thing that appeared in my mind was rabies. And I almost panicked because of it and couldnâ€™t enjoy the show. I went home after feeling very horrible. I couldnâ€™t sleep, a headache kicked in, my fever rose and itâ€™s like my mind was repeating the same scene over and over all night long and I couldnâ€™t sleep at all. Then I woke up around 5 am with a racing heartbeat that wouldnâ€™t slow down at all. I felt awful and was fearful about rabies. 

Since that day, I never ignored my finger where my dog bit me. I still feel pain and a minor tingling sensation where he bit me and all I can think about is if I have rabies. Itâ€™s practically on a daily basis I look at the spot. I have no idea how to get past this. Itâ€™s been 9 months since the incident and I still worry about getting it. I just canâ€™t shake this fear out of my mind. I thought the spot where he bit me would be gone but the area is still red as if itâ€™s been only a couple of weeks since heâ€™s bitten me. 

Iâ€™ve tried everything, such as logic. Itâ€™s exceedingly rare in the US, most rabies cases have been from bats in the US or contracted outside. Last person to die from a dog rabies in the US was in 1974. Basically when my parents were still kids. And Iâ€™m 25 now. My dog survived the 10 day quarantine and we vaccinated him after those 10 days just in case. 

Like I canâ€™t shake the fear. Each time my finger is in pain or even get a tingling sensation, my mind instantly jumps to that conclusion. I almost donâ€™t care about anything else.

"Scared about Stomach Cancer Iâ€™ve had some pretty bad abdominal pain/cramping the last few days that also moves up my chest and feels like heartburn when I lie down. It was so bad today I went to the ER because I was getting pretty nervous. I told my symptoms to the doctor which include pain in my mid/high abdomen, more pain when lying down, more heartburn at night etc. 

He told me I had classic symptoms of acid reflux and put me on some Zantac. I just started it today and he gave me a months worth to take until it helps with the Acid Reflux. He also told me that when he checked with his stethoscope that all my bowel sounds were normal and it my digestive track was working fine. I asked him if I needed a CT or if they found anything strange and he said no.

But Iâ€™ve dug myself deep into a hole and Iâ€™m convinced from all the shit Iâ€™ve read online that the abdominal pain is from stomach cancer even though I donâ€™t show other signs. Can anyone give me some tips on how to deal with this HA? Itâ€™s getting really bad now, and Iâ€™m sure the stress is probably adding to my pain/cramps. ",1

"Kidney infection? Iâ€™m a 36yo female.
A few weeks ago I recognized a UTI coming on. I did what we all do and started drinking a ton of water and taking my cranberry/probiotic capsules. By chance, my annual gyno exam was like two days after it started. Even though my symptoms had started to get better (with still occasional pain with urination) I asked them about it. They said they didnâ€™t see anything, but I begged and she begrudgingly gave me 3 days worth of antibiotics. 
Then I started getting back pain.. but this is normal for me, I have back problems. It was across my lower back so didnâ€™t seem to be specifically over my kidneys. It got pretty bad and I went to urgent care where they did another urine which was clear again (possibly because of the super short dose of antibiotics the week prior) they gave me muscle relaxants and sent me on my way. 
The NEXT week (this week) the pain started to intensify. It started keeping me up at night and was definitely over where my right kidney should be. Back to urgent care. They said I had blood etc in my itinerary this time. Did a CT scan but didnâ€™t see stones. Gave me fluids and pain meds, and a script for  keflex and sent me on my way. 
I got about two doses under my belt, and woke up yesterday morning with excruciating pain that now radiated to my abdomen as well. I was getting cold chills and nausea. I headed for the ER. 
They ran a gamut of tests on me and concluded that itâ€™s a raging kidney infection. They admitted me and Iâ€™ve been on IV pain meds and antibiotics. My white cell count, which was pretty high, is normalizing. No more chills or nausea. 
My question is, why isnâ€™t my pain going away? When the meds wear off itâ€™s still excruciating! Iâ€™m a realist.. I know thereâ€™s still going to be SOME pain.. Iâ€™ve been in the hospital for two days though and it ruts almost exclusively in my abdomen now. The nurse canâ€™t seem to explain it to me, and I wonâ€™t see the doctor until the morning. Iâ€™m concerned that this is something more nefarious than a kidney infection but Iâ€™m wondering if anyone has had an experience like this or has any input at all really that might help.

"Very scared about joint pain, have had health anxiety for months Hi all, 

I'm 20 years old and since November I have been suffering from health anxiety. I have always has mild anxiety but it never got in the way of me living my life. Now though everyday, all I can think about is my health and the symptoms I have. In the past four months I have thought I have breast cancer, lung cancer, gallstones, stomach ulcers, peripheral artery disease, peripheral neuropathy, etc. The list goes on. I have been to the doctors so many times. As soon as I'm not worrying about one symptom anymore, a new one shows up. 

For the past month I have had strange feelings in my legs (random numbness and shooting pains). My feet also get red and burn when I stand for too long. My doc diagnosed me with venous insufficiency but I couldn't stop worrying it was something else. I started noticing that a lot of the time the pain is in my joints. Since then, almost 24/7 I have some pain in my joints ranging from mild to very painful. Yesterday I even started feeling pain in my TM joint. I am convinced I have rheumatoid arthritis because I also have lack of appetite and low iron. I emailed my doctor about this Tuesday and she hasn't gotten back to me and I am so worried I am thinking I'm going to go to an urgent care. I have also read that joint pain can result from anxiety which I try to convince myself that that is what is happening to me but I am still so worried.

My mom is trying to convince me that I am fine but she doesn't know that for sure. I am literally on the verge of tears almost all of the time and cry almost daily. I can't focus on schoolwork because my mind always drifts back to the pain. I am so tired of living like this and not being able to tell if my symptoms are a result from anxiety or from a disease. I just want to go back to how I was before.

Has anyone here experienced something similar? Should I go to an urgent care just in case? ",1

"what should be the Best time of my life, is being absolutely destroyed by ALS fears I dont know what to do. I have had twitching, muscles in specific areas decreasing, and feelings of weakness marked by certain muscles seemingly taking over for the ones that are lost, such as when i walk, ect. for over three years this has been an issue that i have had to ensure myself that it's nothing, and was able to ignore it blissfully for the most part, especially last year in an exciting freshman year of college. But then, back in august i met an amazing girl and suddenly everything came crashing down. My future was important to ensure for myself, so I started paying more attention to my body for reassurance. And boom. The issue was not gone, and I knew it. It was worse, in fact. It had spread. The next three months were nothing short of hell. I lost myself. No sense of self. Life itself felt super meaningless and artificial. I thought about death daily. How to kill myself in the least horrible way if i got the diagnosis. My faith was depleted. It felt like I actually died inside. And all this at the time that should have been THE BEST of my life, aka honeymoon phase of a new exciting relationship. It effected us negatively, obviously.  Thank God, in december I somehow felt like i came back to life. I can only credit God for answering my distressed, desperate prayers the entire month prior. I was able to focus on my life and my relationship in Jan, Feb, and march, which were all GREAT, with these health worries still present but always able to be beaten.

"Suddenly Developed Health Anxiety Greetings Redditors,

This is my first post ever on this website, honestly the first blog that I could think of to go to and I really need some advice. Im a 21 year old Male.

When I turned 21 in September I developed a severe drinking habit. I would drink every night to black out. This continued from September through January. After January first I decided to quit cold turkey which I believe caused my body a great deal of stress. When I was detoxing I began to google my symptoms. This was my first obsession with my health. I settled on having Diabetes. It all added up in my head, the light headedness, tingling in my feet and hands, and lots of sweating. I went to the doctor after 2 to 3 days of intense worry to find out I was perfectly healthy with near perfect cholesterol, sugar, iron, etc levels.

In around mid February I came to the conclusion that this is an anxiety disorder.

I was talking to someone on FaceTime and laughed really hard at what they said. While I was laughing I felt/heard a click in my head (probably just my jaw) and immediately thought I had had a brain aneurysm. I then for the next three or four days was having terrible (what I know now) panic attacks.

This transitioned into me believing that my panic attacks were Heart attacks and the slurred speech I got when I was coming out of the attack to be me having a Stroke despite not ever displaying symptoms of Stroke, Heart Attack, Aneurysm, etc. 

The attacks would be so bad that I would for days feel like I was walking around in a dream, a buzzing feeling in my head, strong sensitivity to light and sound. I just felt like complete shit always. This was often paired up with severe tension headaches and the sensation of cold water being poured on my head (always the right side which further worried me, thought I was having strokes)

Every single day since that day it has been something else. Ive convinced myself that I am anemic, diabetic, having liver failure, having appendicitis, having eye cancer, tonsil cancer, bone cancer. You name it I've probably convinced myself of it.

Currently I am struggling with a bump behind my right molar. This is on the side of the gum line and more than 100% sure it is a wisdom tooth coming in completely sideways (as I am that age). However my sympathetic nervous system decided to force me to believe that it was a tumor and that I was going to die. This caused me to have probably close to a dozen panic attacks over the course of around 3 hours. Each one lasting anywhere from a few minutes to 20-30. Hyperventilation, racing heart, sharp chest pain, feeling of impending doom, sweating, and aggressive crying.

Before I quit drinking, I never worried about anything. I could handle an extreme workload without even the slightest repercussion. And now seemingly every single day its a new worry that makes it so that I just want to fucking die. 

Ive never seen a Doctor for the disorder, just to have them check up on the symptoms that I think I'm experiencing.

My main question is, has this happened to anyone before? Like an anxiety disorder developing seemingly overnight, the course of a few days? Or is this extremely abnormal.

At this point Im just really really scared and want to start to feel normal again. I don't know what to do..",1

"I'm getting a colonoscopy and I'm freaking terrified I've had minor GI bleeding for a while that warrants a colonoscopy. I want to do it because at the very least it'll give me a peace of mind but it's the biggest procedure I've had so far in my life and the first time I'll be under sedation, so I'm absolutely freaking out. I'm 25, people my age don't usually go under colonoscopies so it's kind of hard to talk about this with others. 

Even the prep alone sounds awful thanks to all the horror stories. I know it's a routine procedure for folks way older than me but I'm still pretty scared. Has anyone here gotten a colonoscopy at a young age? One of the things that concerns me is that I've heard people who have IBS have worse symptoms after the procedure likely due to the prep.",1
"Skin cancer fears Skin cancer is a specific fear of mine because of a few awful burns I've had in the past. I'm pale, so I burn incredibly easily. I am 100% convinced I am going to get skin cancer eventually.

There's a small bump on the back of my head, no bigger than the tip of my thumb. I can't see it, but apparently it's pink. You know when you get a bump on your head from hitting it and there's sort of a dull pain when pressure is applied to it? That's how it feels when I press on the bump that's on the back of my head. It's hard, you can't really press down on it.

As I type this I'm pretty anxious because I'm convinced whatever the bump on my head is is going to kill me. There are so many different ways skin cancer can look, and I'm scared that's what I have. I don't remember hitting my head on anything recently, and even if I did, I've never had a bump form that was that small before.",1

Currently worrying I have cervical cancer and I canâ€™t check because I have vaginismus whenever I try to have smear tests. Iâ€™ve had a lot going on since October last year and tried to seek answers from health professionals (I say that so lightly) and people on Reddit for advice. Iâ€™ve had loads of symptoms since January that you can get with various stages of cervical cancer but I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s based on basic stuff. Iâ€™ve had around 5+ blood tests, stool samples, ultrasounds of my ovaries in that time and two unsuccessful smear exams. Iâ€™m super scared but apparently any changes could be picked up in bloodwork Iâ€™ve been told by a semi professional, my bfâ€™s mum is a GP so I try to ask him to get her opinions etc. Iâ€™m so scared and keep googling cervical cancer and the signs.

My problems began last July. I went on a swimming pool and got an earful of water (the left one). Ever since, I've had the following symptoms:

Feeling of something liquid in the left ear

"Anxiety about rabies exposures I'm extremely frustrated and scared and not sure how to resolve this. A few years ago I was bitten by a wild animal and received the rabies post-exposure prophylaxis. Then last fall I was bitten by a different wild animal and received booster doses.

Now I've been scratched by a third wild animal. I don't want receive more doses of the vaccine.

"Dizziness, pressure in head, headaches, strange seizure-like episodes - brain tumor or sinus infection? Hey all. I'm making a doctor's appointment first thing in the moring but I'd like some advice on what I am experiencing in the meantime. 

For a couple months I have been getting these strange episodes that I can only describe as pseudo-seizures. One of the most notable symptoms is that I suddenly have this overwhelming sensation of physical buildup, like you get right before a good sneeze or before you start crying. However, that release doesn't come, so I get urges to make noise like moaning or screaming to force the feeling out. Another big symptom is a sudden inability or difficulty in swallowing. It's like I've forgotten how to move my tongue properly or like my mouth is too dry, and I can only partially swallow. I have to push food to the back of my throat so that it's already partially down and then struggle to get it the rest of the way. I stop eating when this happens because I don't want to risk choking. Other symptoms are a tightness in the back of my head, confusion, and sometimes waves of tingles or energy washing over my scalp. The waves are very brief, but will repeat over and over for up to 20 minutes. When they stop, the rest of the symptoms go away too. I havent gotten too many of these the past couple weeks but they were nearly constant a month ago.

For the past couple weeks I have been having sporadic dizzy spells that feel like my body is floating or like my brain is swimming around in my head. Sometimes I get queasy during these spells. I noticed that they seemed to come or be worsened when looking at screens like my phone or computer, so I eventually figured it must be cybersickness. I am using my devices less and more carefully, and the dizzy spells got better for a few days.

However, now I am having very uncomfortable pressure in my head that seems to move around. It is mainly in my temples and the back of my head, but sometimes I can feel it in my nose too. It ranges from being annoying to feeling like my head has been put in a gentle hydraulic press. I feel dizzy when the pressure worsens.

Every so often, my right hand will feel slightly numb, and it feels like I've lost some fine motor control in it. However it's hard to tell if that is real or is just anxiety. It could also be carpal tunnel because I am an artist and it's in the hand I use to do most everything. It usually goes away in a few minutes to an hour.

I have been dealing with issues with my eyeglass prescription for the past few months. My old prescription had run its course and had started giving me trouble so I went and got a new one a few weeks ago, but it's too strong so I'm getting them bumped down a bit now.

Here are my ""crazy"" concerns - brain tumor, adult-onset hydrocephalus, brain cancer (cancer is of least concern because I recently had bloodwork and it came back perfect, so I shouldn't have that)

My more realisic theories are - sinus issues like infection or irritation, anxiety, eye strain from not wearing my glasses and having an outdated/overpowered prescription.

I was getting my prescription rewritten today and my eye doctor looked at my eyes to see if he could find any sign of a tumor, and he said everything looked good to him but I'm still worried.

What are all your thoughts? Do you think those strange episodes are really seizures? Should I be worried I have a tumor?",1

If so, is there any chance I caused kidney damage by not catching it earlier? 

Possibly relevant: I also have a sinus infection/cold right now. 

The doctor hasnâ€™t called yet to explain the results (just got them this morning). I guess I just need talking down.",1
"Anxiety Brain Eating Amoeba IÂ´ve had health anxiety for about 8 months now, IÂ´ve always wanted to post here but have always been too sacred. For me, everything started with a scan my wife had and in the wait I started searching for possible causes and then started getting her symptoms. At first it was pancreatic cancer, then lun cancer, the stomach cancer etc. I have gotten help and have actually been partially hospitalized for my anxiety. For my regular health, got an abdominal ultrasound and all clear. At about he 6 month mark I started eating persistent headaches and thatâ€™s when thins got really bad. At that point I was convinced I was dying so I went to my Dr and told her about the headaches. Although I suffer from migraines and have had bouts of persistent headaches in the past, she recommended a sinus x ray and a head mri just to be clear and so I could calm down. Although the mri is this coming Wednesday, I have been relatively stable for about 3 weeks, until yesterday that is. Yesterday I was cleaning out my lawnmower and accidentally got a little bit of carburetor cleaner in my forehead. In order to make the sting go away, I went to the hose and but some water in my forehead, however, some water went into my nose and now I canÂ´t stop thinking about the brain eating amoeba. I live in PR so weather here is warm and I really cant function right now due to fear of the brain eating amoeba. Any advice would be appreciated.

"Does anyone get health anxiety about a loved one or pet? I canâ€™t live like this. I have everything Iâ€™ve ever wanted and all I am is constantly scared to lose it. My mom got breast cancer this year. It was caught early and is hopefully treatable. But itâ€™s sent my already anxious mind into a tailspin!!!! I canâ€™t stop reading sad stories and looking over at the love of my life, laying in bed next to me, and imagining him withering away of cancer. I freak out if he has a headache (or myself). Ask him to check his testicles all the time. Iâ€™m trying so hard to live in the moment because Iâ€™m so scared of the mortality of life but itâ€™s causing me to panic about living in the moment.
Does this make sense to anyone? Like I feel this urgent need to get married, book plan tickets, just anything to start ticking off the things I want to do â€œin case something badâ€ is about to happen.
I find myself in these deep dark holes.
My beloved rescue cat, sheâ€™s only 4, I found a black lump on her chin. Immediately googled and found cat skin cancer. Couldnâ€™t sleep. Was in a full-on panic, cried, lamented the unfairness of losing a young pet. Turns out it was cat acne. Lol wtf. Seriously.
Oh and I have this tiny black dot under my toenail, my doctor brushed it off but referred me to a dermatologist (for unrelated reasons) and said they would look at it. Well, Iâ€™m convinced itâ€™s subaungal melanoma. Itâ€™s sunny out so I walked around the house barefoot today. The black dot just looked at me. I googled. Melanoma can spread as quickly as 6 weeks. Well TOO BAD MY DERM. APPT ISNT FOR 8 WEEKS. Thatâ€™s just great.

"Reinforcing Anxiety by going to the doctor Recently I have been thinking about whether or not I should go to the doctor for the bigger  problems I can't seem to shake. I was told a while back I had a lesion in my leg that was most likely benign and then that was it. I didn't hear anything back from any doctor about it and I didn't know where to go or what to do about it and my HA went through the roof because of it. 

I recently went to my main doctor and asked him about it. He told me they can't legally say 100% something is benign because they can be sued over it, but reallistically it most likely was benign. He said that I could always get an x-ray if I needed reassurance to make sure it hasn't changed ar all. 

My question is this, what do you guys think you would do in my position? 

I have had enough radiation in my body already and I want to avoid it as much as possible. And I feel like maybe not going and getting the x-ray can teach me more skills that I need to cope. I know something is there but I still have to live my life. And trust in my faith of God.

"I don't wanna eat [Trigger Warning] I do not know if this is the right subreddit for this; if its not then please redirect me to a proper subreddit.

I do not think know if this counts as an eating disorder or not. I think about not eating sometimes although I have not acted upon it. The reason why I don't want to eat is because of my periods. If I don't eat I will not get my period. I have really bad anxiety when it comes to menstruation. This post I made explains why.

https://www.reddit.com/r/menstruation/comments/af32dw/i_wanna_talk_about_menophobia_my_story/

My period is the main cause of my anxiety. I'm tired of being ashamed and embarrassed about this. I'm tired of being not like everyone else. I just don't want to put up this anymore. I'd like to add that I haven't started to starve myself, these are just intrusive thoughts. Although, I kinda want to stop eating.

I'm not calling this an eating disorder is because it has nothing to do weight or body image. As you can see, this is very complicated. If I do stop eating, I'll take everything into consideration.

The only way for me to be happy is without my period. I'll eat when I don't have my period that month or whatever.

I want to try to conquer my fear of sex/menstruation. But I know I can't do it. People on Reddit say that I should try to learn about what's going on in body so that I won't be afraid. I definitely can't do that. I'm a loser because of this.

I blame myself a lot for being this fear. Its all my fault. I hit myself from time to time because I feel so stupid. I have not told my family that I think about not eating anything. I feel too guilty to tell someone. People already don't understand why I feel uncomfortable about sexuality and menstruation. Life sucks.

"How do you cope with bad stool anxiety? (Gross?) I've been struggling with this particular health anxiety for some months now.

I've been suffering heavily from health anxiety for 9 months now. But this isn't some muscle ache or dizziness I can just ignore.

The stool keeps going from having weeks where it's too soft, to weeks where it's semi back to normal. Sometimes I see small red...bits? in it. 

When I went to my doctor about it the first time, I performed a couple of feces tests. I got a slightly elevated white blood cell count on one of them.

Then like 2 months ago I cried hysterically because I started dripping fresh red blood after a visit. 

Doctor discovered that there was a small hemorroid near the opening. I've done more tests much later on, so far they've come out negative, I have one more test I need to do that is quite time consuming. 

He assured me that it's way too rare that it can be colon cancer (I'm 20 and have no history) and that he sees no real reason to worry.

But I'm relapsing again two weeks after feeling fine about it. I got a very small amount of blood. I know it's much more likely that it was a tear cause it hurt quite a bit coming out. But it awakened the beast from it's slumber...

I just don't know how to ignore stuff like this and carry on. It's not like a muscle pain which can be anything and ignored. It's too visual and clear to my eyes.

TLDR: How do you deal with a visual symptom like finding something bad in your feces?",1
"Recent onset of HA, Trying to nip it in the bud Hi all.
Back in November I had a rather large health scare. I had a real symptom that I was dealing with for 2 years, I thought it was just something simple so I kept putting it off. I never had HA before, and was so laid back I let this issue go on for 2 years.
Finally saw a doc about it and immediately was ordered a CT scan. I got afraid it was serious. Went in for the scan and had to wait 12 days to get the results back since it was over Thanksgiving. I was... not myself these days. Pretty much mortified as I was finally coming to terms with my mortality, wishing I went earlier, etc...

Thankfully, to SO MUCH RELIEF, the scans came back clean. The issue I had was very real, however. Docs knocked it up to a really bad cold I had that did some damage on my body. Annoying, but manageable. Thankfully not the big C or a brain tumor. 

I am healthy.

Since then, however, I've been shook. It's been some time now, but since I've had more HA than I ever had before. My family line is healthy, I'm relatively healthy, etc. 

However, I've been over analyzing myself and have thus far 'induced' two issues. The main one being over-noticing my eye floaters and oddities I had my whole life, that I literally never had before. Eye things seem to be the big thing right now with me, I don't know. I DON'T have visual snow, but am afraid if I think about it too much, I might get it. 

I have an eye exam scheduled soon. I was due for a standard one anyway, but I don't know why my mind is in 'something is wrong with your eye' mode when my eyes have been like this my whole life (And I have had many normal exams).

I really want to nip this in the bud, before it gets too bad. 

I think it's still 'young' and I can overcome it and beat it before it consumes my life. I need to. 

I'm looking for self help methods right now. Guides, meditations, even books. Please do not suggest therapy at this time. It is something I may consider in the future, but I am not in the right place or mindset for it right now (Had a traumatic experience with it in the past. I need therapy for my therapy. Ha.) 

But any advice on self-help that I can do right now would be really appreciated. I've been listening to positive affirmations on youtube which has helped a lot. I think I can get over this, I just need direction.

Thank you so much.",1
"lived in Vermont apartment for over a year, possibly with dangerous radon levels I'm a 28-year-old male, reasonably fit, moved to Montpelier, VT over a year ago. Yesterday at work I overheard two women talking about a tunnel that was cordoned off due to dangerously high radon levels. I did some research, and apparently Montpelier is a death zone with abnormally high levels all across, with the average being a whopping 3.4.

I'm an introvert and spend a lot of time indoors, horribly afraid of cancer and now I'm convinced I'm going to develop lung cancer. Haven't had the radon levels in my apartment checked, and I can't afford a contractor to do the job right.

It all started with me having a tight throat feeling which I have because of GERD (I didnâ€™t know at that time), and I searched it up on google and all my symptoms matched thyroid cancer, etc. I got panic attacks, laying in bed for hours searching on google at age 13.  It became so bad that I never went outside. I used to either tell my friends Iâ€™m sick, or just talk to them over the phone to something. 2014 is when I developed my first real disease, called Visual Snow, symptoms are where you are tiny dots over your vision, like pixels.

"Neti Pot Anxiety I was recently diagnosed with a sinus infection and told to use a Neti Pot.  Being careful to read the directions, I took off the nasal cap and washed it with soap and my bathroom sink water, then poured distilled water over it to rinse.

As I looked things up I became even more scared, reading that tap water with Neti Pots can be dangerous.  I haven't touched the thing since, and my sinus headaches are becoming increasingly easier for my anxious mind to read as some kind of horrible brain amoeba like you can find stories on.

"Should I be worried about a possible auditory hallucination? Hi guys,

Today I was on a empty street waiting for my Uber when I heard a baby cry for about a few seconds, twice. I did not hear this sound again, and it sounded like it came from one of my houses, as some of the houses had their lights on. I did not see the baby though, and I have not heard this sound again. 

I am worried this might be the onset of Schizophrenia, yet my psychiatrist said I do not have any of the positive/negative symptoms.

"HA and a Palm Tree lead me to urgent care To preface, I just discovered this sub and WOW, I canâ€™t believe thereâ€™s so many others who struggle with the same issues I do. Iâ€™ve struggled with HA since I was about 14 (Iâ€™m 24 now), and I go through periods of time where Iâ€™m fine, and then Iâ€™ll hit a rough couple of weeks that leave me absolutely crippled. 

So, couple of weeks ago (after many years of worry, I am a former smoker) I finally got the reassurance that I did not have lung cancer due to shortness of breath. Following that positive news I thought to myself â€œokay great, finally my HA will calm down.â€ That was short lived. A couple of days ago I was attempting to clean palm tree debris and got stuck by a leaf/thorn. Naturally it lead me to google it because it got slightly swollen and I convinced myself I had a serious infection and Plant Thorn Arthritis (Thanks Google) So off to the urgent care I went, they laughed at me when I demanded a Tetnus shot and gave me antibiotics and sent me on my way. 

I still canâ€™t stop thinking about how I might have to get surgery to remove plant debris, itâ€™s been consuming every thought of mine even though the swelling has gone down. In other news, Iâ€™ve had a slight tenderness in my thigh for a few months and my googling has lead me to believe I have a DVT. Iâ€™m freaking out and scheduled another doctorâ€™s appointment for Monday.... 

I luckily have a very supportive SO that recognizes when Iâ€™m on my bad weeks with HA and is my safe person. It just sucks so much, we have so much planned the next few weeks and all I can focus on is my impending death.

"How to stop the feedback loop? I finally got over my own health anxiety. There are many 'problems' I have that I don't really worry about anymore. yay.

In exchange I am now worrying about the health of others like crazy. Some people in my life either have or died to cancer and right now I only have my mother left of my family. Not a day goes by where I am not building up a scenario in my head where she will die soon. It doesn't help that she is the type of person to never see a doctor, so I spend every waking moment trying to find a way to make her get her appointments.

The thing is I really want to stop, somedays I tell myself how unlikely all of this is (even looking up global statistics) and that I should just stop and go on.

But then it's my fault if she dies. That is all I ever think about. Because I didn't make her go, so it wasn't found and I will never ever forgive myself that. So I go right back to 'I need to worry'.

"Love Yourself Good morning Reddit users! I wanted to pass some words or love and support.

We are all here because of our health anxiety whether we have it now, or we had it in the past and weâ€™re just trying to support others.

I wanted to tell everyone...

Breathe.

Why is that so important? Because when we are all trapped inside our own thoughts and obsessed with our problems we feed into our pain, our stress, and our anxiety. Thatâ€™s what our anxiety wants! Take a moment to step back and relax, let your body unravel since itâ€™s so tense you wonâ€™t even notice it! Close your eyes, take deep breaths just to let your mind go back to normal. Because if you continue to worry and stress, your symptoms of whatever youâ€™re feeling get worse! Then you begin to analyze â€œnewâ€ symptoms and youâ€™ll start to worry about those. So just breathe please.

We as human beings sometimes forget to love ourselves and appreciate the small steps we take against our anxiety! Please give yourself a pat on the back, congratulate yourself for taking this small step! Donâ€™t ever feel like youâ€™re alone, weâ€™re all here to help each other because we want the best for each other, we might feel like weâ€™re in a hole. But we can get out of here I promise you all, we just need the support and the love because with that we can counter attack the mind. Itâ€™s powerful, but we canâ€™t let it take advantage of us! We gotta control it and use it to our advantage! 

I hope all you have a wonderful day, and week, and month, and year. Let this be our year! Letâ€™s tackle this together!

I love you all. Letâ€™s beat this together. â¤ï¸",1

"An Arrow To The Knee Hello everyone! 

Recently, I have been going through a bout of health anxiety due to a nasty head cold. Lots of dizziness and headaches have been fueling my worries, making me feel very disconnected and depressed. I have been constantly worrying that this will never end or that something more serious is going on.

Earlier today, I was starting to have a bit of a panic/anxiety attack so I decided to go for a drive and clear my head while listening to some music. I ended up driving to a park, watching the sun set, and taking a walk, which really helped me regain focus on reality and calm down. Luckily, on my evening stroll I found a fence with some graffiti reading â€œLet It Beâ€ which reminded me of a lesson my old therapist gave me. I think it could help a lot of people on this sub.

She used to compare any condition or small symptom causing worry to being hit with an arrow.  *cue Skyrim guard life story* Going ahead and excessively worrying about the first arrow, to the extent that many of us do, is like shooting yourself with another arrow.  I am already suffering from a sinus infection, why would I then exacerbate my anxiety by worrying about it more than I should? This could extend to anything we worry about, a headache, a sore stomach, etc. Donâ€™t let a small, insignificant symptom we are dealing with create more issues, just let it be and it will pass. That headache you think is brain cancer, will go away! That leg twitch you think is early signs of ALS, will go away! Donâ€™t take an arrow to the knee from life and shoot yourself with another. 

I hope this helps some peopleâ€™s worries!",1

Ever since Rachel Star Withers' face was eaten away by flesh-eating bacteria, I have been living under the constant fear that I might end up with the same fate as hers. I know how rare necrotizing fasciitis is (0.0004%) but I just can't seem to get my mind off it. I have, because of this, become a germaphobe and was compelled to wash my hands with soap after picking up anything from a surface that I consider just a bit unclean. As a result, my overly dry hands are now cracking and it's creating small, tiny wounds on my skin, which only made the situation worse cause necrotizing fasciitis usually occurs with certain types of bacteria entering wounds on one's skin. I understand that the best thing to do right now is to stay away from this irrational hand washing habit of mine but I simply can't do it. To make things worse, I always feel like I have touched something dirty when in reality, I haven't. For instance, when I walk pass a trash can a bit too close, I feel really uncomfortable and go straight to the bathroom to wash my hands. I only came close to touching it, but my mind is telling me that I have, indeed, already touched it.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been going through hypochondria for quite some time but now I really feel like I'm going crazy. Has anybody ever experienced this? Can some of you please give me some advice on this. From how to deal with the flesh-eating bacteria craze to how to stop being a germaphobe. It can be anything. I just want all this to stop.

"My fingernails are giving me so much anxiety!!! I have not been this anxious for so long. I've dealt with health anxiety in the past about many different things that seem so much more serious and like more confronting (for me) like stroke and heart disease since those are two things that have been in my family. But within the past two weeks I have been incredibly anxious about my fingernails because my two thumb nails have ridges in them, almost like lumps. Of course I googled, I know, I shouldn't. I did though, and it was filled with kidney disease and all these terrible things and now I am unbelievably anxious. My therapist cut us back from weekly to fortnightly visits and now to monthly and my appointment got delayed for another two weeks even though it's been a whole month. I don't feel like I want to share this anxiety to him because I am embarrassed. I feel silly that I am so anxious and paranoid about my fingernails, but the reality is that I can't stop thinking about it even when I'm not directly thinking about it. I'm constantly checking google to see if I can find something that maybe says it's ok and it's nothing to worry about but I can't and it's making it worse. Ahhh",1

"Woo! Heart Woes. Iâ€™ve been dealing with bad heart palpitations since I was about 12 years old; my parents always told me it was anxiety attacks, as they run in the family.
In early February I had a bad anxiety attack with palpitations, which triggered about a 3 week period of time where my heart was just fluttering constantly, while I was laying in bed, trying to sleep, doing nothing, etc... I seriously felt like I was going to die, which then triggered a super intense depression like Iâ€™d never felt in my life. I finally gave in and went into Urgent Care once I had enough, where the doctor did an EKG and measured my resting heart rate at about 136 bpm. They urged me to go to emergency, so I did, and $1,000+ later they told me I was totally fine, my heart likes to jump around a lot but palpitations are normal and they recommended I start meditating. I donâ€™t doubt the constant fluttering was probably due to health anxiety since I felt so scared from it. I took their advice, started meditating, got a breathing app, and decided to find a heart rate app to measure my bpm when it happens, since Iâ€™m never able to get into emergency when the palpitations are actually happening. Itâ€™s been giving me a little peace of mind to see whatâ€™s going on when I feel them and sometimes itâ€™s not so bad as I feel like it is, my heart rate is usually 90-110 bpm, seems okay enough. It also helps me just to have a visual of whats going on. Anyway, after a couple more weeks of meditating, drinking lots of water and pulling myself out of my funk, I seemed alright again and convinced myself itâ€™s all in my head.

Today I was shopping, bent over to pick something up, and it triggered really intense palpitations. My heart was pounding so hard that my entire body was shaking. I kept trying to calm down but had no luck- I remembered the heart rate app and pulled it out to see the severity of the situation. The app couldnâ€™t even measure it for a minute, I watched the lines squiggling all over the place extremely tiny and just bouncing everywhere. Finally got a reading of 210 bpm, and so I sat and tried to calm down some more, and it finally slowed to about 160bpm, then about 10 minutes later I was back in the low 100s range. Now its been a couple hours and Iâ€™m comfortable in the 90â€™s. Iâ€™m super tired now but I feel like I handled it like a champ this time. Itâ€™s weird to experience a feeling like your heart is going to blow up but to have doctors tell you youâ€™re fine. What a fun time :) Anyway, my sister says she knows of a cardiologist, Iâ€™m going to see if theyâ€™re accepting patients. I doubt Iâ€™ll get in anytime soon, since all the doctors in my area are booked out for months, but it is what it is I guess. Reading posts on this page and how other people deal with it has really helped me through all of this, so thank you everyone whoâ€™s shared their heart related stories! I donâ€™t feel like thereâ€™s any advice I havenâ€™t tried yet, but I still wanted to share my experience and get it off my chest!",1

"How to give more power to positive thoughts, automatic negative thoughts causing panic attacks I have been suffering from constant automatic irrational negative thoughts for 7 months now. I have had a checkup on every part of my body including 3 heart checkups, I am literally completely fine. Iâ€™m a healthy young adult that used to go gym a lot. Since, my anxiety has heightened Iâ€™ve stopped going gym in the fear of something happening and I get regular panic attacks. I feel like Iâ€™ve been getting better each month but currently my senses are heightened a lot to whatâ€™s happening in my stomach and back. Any new sensation, it causes me to panic/worrry and bring those thoughts in which makes no rational sense. However, when I am anxious now, I am really forcing myself to say positive things such as no â€œI am fine, I am safe, Iâ€™ve been through this e.t.câ€. But itâ€™s the constant negative irrational thoughts mainly about negative heart connotations or that this person will have to save me or if I go to this place something will happen that constantly pop up and making me excessively panic. I have practiced meditation for a few days now and Iâ€™m listening to positive affirmations everyday
So, thereâ€™s two stages left of my anxiety now that I need to get rid of.
1) extra heightened sense of awareness for any feeling in my stomach or back(I suffer from heartburn and GERD so there are constant sensations). I have been trying to focus on different parts of my body
2) how can I give more power to my positive thoughts which should lead me to be more excited rather than constantly in state of panic due to these automatic negative thoughts

So can anyone help? Every day has pretty much been a struggle in this period, Iâ€™m a college student so Iâ€™ve fallen behind in my work so much.

"Having a severe panic attack, might be triggering  As  of today, I've suddenly begun experiencing a sweet taste in my mouth.  I'm a long time sufferer of health anxiety, and intrusive thoughts  compelled me to start self-diagnosing what the issue could be. While my  family has no history of Diabetes, and I eat well, I saw that it could  be an early symptom for type 2 diabetes. Since I've seen that, I've  convinced myself that that's exactly what it is, and that my life is  over. I'll just have to live with a future of crippling health issues  from here on out. I can't get it out of my mind, and the fear of that is  overwhelming me. I'm hyperventilating, and I don't know what I can do  to put my mind at ease. I know it's probably nothing in reality, but  this idea claws at the back of my mind, going ""What's wrong with looking  out for your health? It's better to catch these things early"" and it  compels me to look further into it, which further perpetuates the cycle.  I'm so tired, and scared, and I don't know what to do.

"Severe Hypochondria after Being on Accutane Hey everyone. Most of my life I have never thought twice about a physical symptom and was confident in my health. However, that changed when I went on Accutane to help my cystic acne in August 2018. I started experiencing physical symptoms such as an increased resting heart rate all the time (around 100 or more bpm when it used to be around 75), stomach issues like indigestion and weird bubbling/gurgling coming up my throat and noises in my stomach when I sucked it in and out which I later researched and believe is succussion splash. I was feeling very anxious about how my body was feeling and felt like I was changing, like I wasn't the same person. I know Accutane is associated with horror stories so that just fueled my anxiety. I stopped the medicine at only 2.5 months instead of completing the full course which was supposed to be 6 months. I was so concerned about my symptoms that I went to three doctors, got an EKG, echocardiogram, different blood tests, and capsule endoscopy. Doctors said everything was normal. Cardiologist agrees that my pulse was a little higher than normal but still in the ""normal range"" and that it's nothing to be worried about (diagnosed it as ""inappropriate sinus tachycardia"") I haven't been able to do things normally since then. I have had better days where I forget my symptoms but it has been bad lately. I went on a trip recently with my mother and I was incredibly anxious the entire time because my symptoms were heightened. I never had trouble with trips so the fact that I am unable to handle things the way I used to is very concerning. I haven't been able to eat normally as I feel nauseous often and have lost weight without trying. I have also felt dizzy and numb? Half of me is saying there is something is terribly wrong with me and that I need to get more tests done and second and third opinions and the other half is saying that my anxiety is what is actually causing the symptoms. It's a vicious cycle. I never used to be this way. It started when I took that medication and my mind is telling me that I will never be the same because of 2.5 months on an acne drug. Meanwhile doctors told me that I am 100% healthy. Please give me advice on what I should do.",1

"Is this shingles? Please help me So for a few days Iâ€™ve had aches on the right side of my upper chest and under my right shoulder blade. Last night I decided to use nutmeg balm to try and soothe the ache. This morning when I woke up and checked myself in the mirror I had this [rash](https://imgur.com/a/z5TaEWc) on the right side of my back on the shoulder blade.

The rash doesnâ€™t hurt when I touch it and doesnâ€™t seem irritated. The only places which hurt are where my muscle ache is, the rash does not cover those areas at all. If itâ€™s shingles normally does the rash itself hurt when you touch it? Iâ€™m confused to whether it actually is shingles or maybe just a reaction to the nutmeg balm. Iâ€™ve used it before and never had a rash afterwards but after I applied the balm on my back last night I was sitting on a bare mattress, duvet and pillows, maybe it could be a reaction to that also?

Please let me know if you have had similar experiences or if I should go see a doctor. Right now the rash doesnâ€™t give me any pain or irritation, the only pain I have is from the aches on my chest and back that were there before the rash",1

Which I might add being in Australia, there hasnâ€™t been any cases as of yet and to my knowledge donâ€™t have deer mice which are apparently a more common mouse to carry the virus. Nonetheless, on Monday when I went into work there was some little black things on my desk that I thought was dried glue from work however turned out to be mouse poo.

The other thing is that if I stop worrying about them, I get comfortable and attached to my lifestyle, and then if something happens, itâ€™s going to be more of a letdown.  This already happened this year.  I got a very small Pilonidal Cyst (now on track to get a minor procedure to remove it), and at first I was devastated - mostly because for a while I had forgotten about the possibility of these things happening, so there was more of a shock value.  Iâ€™m afraid of the shock factor of enjoying my life and being hit with cancer versus expecting it all along and hopefully mitigating a bit of it.",1
"What would you do here? Throwaway becuase my family knows my account...

For some time now I observed 'symptoms' that my mother is showing which make me really afraid that she might have cancer. She is 50 years old and recently started complaining about one sided back pain (she did a lot of physical labor all her live but still concerning), having to urinate more often and feeling full sooner. Ever since my own Doc informed me about the risks of ovarian cancer I can't get it out of my head.

I made her see the doctor but she just went for a normal checkup instead of asking for an ultrasound. They did take a blood sample but that is hardly enough to rule this out right?

I really want to let this go because right now it will be impossible to make her go again and I got enough else to worry about. On the other hand if I am right and stop pushing her it will be my fault it wasn't found early enough...

"Scared to exercise Iâ€™ve had health anxiety for around 5 years now and it was based around a fear of cancer after a scare I had in 2014, but in during a run in February I had a pretty bad panic attack that I mistook for a heart attack/cardiac arrest which really shit me up and Iâ€™ve been terrified of any heart related problems since. I used to love running/working out and would exercise 5/6 times a week, but since the panic attack Iâ€™ve been scared to go for a run or do any strenuous exercises in the gym such as deadlifts. If I do exercise, I spend the entire time terrified something might happen to me and it has just ruined something I used to really enjoy.

"i had some bloodwork this week &amp; last, and now i got my period - is it normal to feel like this, or should i do something? hi, so last week i had some blood taken for a test. and then this past tuesday i had some taken - this one was rough, i almost passed out &amp; threw up. afterwards i felt so gross and tingly and weak. well, i got my period last night. and today iâ€™m back to feeling this tingly weak way - my friend said itâ€™s because they took so much blood and that iâ€™m on my period (which i always have a very heavy flow) and also ik anemic so that doesnâ€™t help lmao.

but yeah no i feel very shaky and my feet are tingling and are going numb, my hands are tingling, and iâ€™m just exhausted. i was at work earlier and jokingly asked my friend to check my pulse and she said it actually felt faster than a normal pulse. 

is this normal? does it make sense? i called my dr just to be safe and they took what i said out of context and went on a tangent and gave a spiel about periods and how i should visit with an OBGYN (which iâ€™m doing at the end of the month) i just absolutely hate this feeling of tingly and weak and exhausted. is there anything i can do to make it better? or is it just a waiting game?",1

"Rash? Eczema? Scabies? ? Iâ€™m and 18F student and ever since coming to college Iâ€™ve had very bad health anxiety, where as soon as any small thing is wrong Iâ€™m online 8-10 hours a day trying to diagnose.
My most recent issue is a rash Iâ€™ve had on my forearms, wrists, and back of my hands for the past few days. Itâ€™s very itchy, mostly at night, and when I scratch I get hive-like spots that sometimes stay, and sometimes go away. I also have little white bumps that are very tiny and donâ€™t show up well in pictures. Iâ€™ve been applying hydrocortisone 1% since Saturday night and itâ€™s still happening so today I bought Benadryl cream and made an appt at my universities health services for tomorrow morning. 
After looking online Iâ€™ve narrowed it down to hives, eczema, scabies, or maybe ringworm. I think scabies scares me the most. I woke up this morning to myself scratching my wrists like crazy after doing so good not scratching, and then I started hyperventilating because I was so scared because I have read scabies is worst at night. Also, Iâ€™ve been feeling itchy around my ears, scalp, and legs but nothing is as itchy or hive like as my wrists.
Overall I donâ€™t really know what else to do as everytime I look at it I freak out and I canâ€™t talk to anyone about it because they laugh when I say it might be scabies or something serious. I feel so stupid. [picture ](https://imgur.com/TBLL4Oc)",1

"how to tell a pimple from early signs of MSRA or flesh eating disease? i'm really hoping this is just from over sweating, i had part of my arm resting on my desk, i was sweating after listen to music rather energetically, i raise my arm and suddenly notice a reddish raised bump that looked like a pimple, only thing was it came on suddenly, i didn't have this before, its not painful, mainly slightly sore/uncomfortable, gets sorer when touched. at first i thought it was just a bite or a pimple, i googled ""Sudden Pimple on arm"" and got a result for ""Woman mistakes flesh eating disease for pimple, dies."" and had a near fucking panic attack. Recently someone in the household had to drive some family to the E.R, i'm worried they might have tracked some sort of MRSA back with them, as they had to stay for a few hours. I'm really hoping this is just a sweat pimple, because the desk could have been impairing the skins ability to breath. I used to get similar bumps on my legs when working out with some particularly uncomfortable briefs, so i'm really hoping thats all it is but i can't shake the fear that it could be something more severe.",1
"Possible explanation for brain fog, headaches, fatigue, dizziness with normal lab/imaging findings Hi all,

I really hope this doesn't stir up more anxiety for anyone, but I have a possible explanation for some of the symptoms that often pop up here, especially for the folks that think they have a brain tumor. 

When the bones of the neck are not in proper alignment (a lordotic curve), whether from past trauma (e.g. whiplash, repetitive micro trauma), or poor posture, it can cause a bunch of symptoms that a lot of people are attributing to brain tumors (headaches, dizziness, vision issues, brain fog, fatigue etc.). A formal x-ray/CT/MRI report will not usually comment on an absent lordotic curve if there is nothing pathologically wrong (bone spurs, herniations etc.) with the vertebrae or disc space, but a non-lordotic curve does cause real symptoms. I came across this information through physio/chiro, so if you're someone that slouches and has migraines and headaches, try keeping your chin tucked in, don't stay in awkward positions, take breaks from computer work, drink water, get a comfortable pillow, and keep your shoulders rolled back. 

I know not everyone's issues are related to this but it may be worth a try if your medical tests all came back negative but you're still experiencing symptoms.",1
"Neck lump/pain Looking for some reassurance or advice if anyone else has experienced this. Two days ago I noticed a lump on the left side of my neck under my jaw. Itâ€™s painful when I turn my head to the left and when I swallow. Iâ€™m thinking itâ€™s a swollen lymph node but I donâ€™t have any other symptoms of an infection (cold, flu, etc) besides very mild left ear pain (like maybe the beginning of an ear infection?). Iâ€™m sure itâ€™s nothing but it is causing some serious anxiety, itâ€™s all I can think about. My thoughts are immediately jumping to lymphatic cancer or a malignant tumor. Iâ€™m planning to make a doctors appointment if Iâ€™m still feeling weird tomorrow. Has anyone else experienced something similar to this?",1

Bad move. Now I'm even more anxious about it because there were so many people saying it causes heart attacks and their daughter has died from Nuvaring and blah blah. I have heart palpitations from anxiety and now I'm worried it's not anxiety and actually a sign of my Nuvaring slowly trying to kill me. Ugh.",1
"Overcoming personal anxiety by helping others Long time HA sufferer and poster. I am fortunate enough to say I have managed my HA enough to a point where itâ€™s not consistently affecting my life. Just want to share a few pearls. 

Our health anxiety is very self centered. We obsess over health , our bodies, etc. the key to recovery is to stop focusing on ourselves. More on this later. 

Everybody on here is a bit different. I personally feel a sense of relief with medical testing , doctor visits etc; but some are fearful of those things. For that reason this post may not apply to you. 

A lot of us are in the medical field. I myself am a dentist and have had the irony of dealing with hypochondriacs in my office who are worried about oral cancer. 

Examining a fearful patient the other day , and reassuring him that he does not have oral cancer, gave me an epiphany of sorts, which led me to the following. 

Today I joined the national bone marrow donation match website. Itâ€™s a wonderful opportunity to help out people that are going through what we all in this sub fear the most- terminal cancer. 

Think about it, you can save a life!Minimal procedure. A needle in your hip. Some painkillers and you are on your way. 

Not only that but thereâ€™s such a barrage of testing beforehand that you can all but be guaranteed that you donâ€™t have any sort of underlying illness. (They only take 18-44 year old healthy donors for the most part ) all of the testing is free and meals and rides are covered. 

I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll ever get called but the whole thing puts my personal health anxieties in perspective.  To save a childâ€™s life from leukemia, for example, would forever change your life. 

Iâ€™m not saying you need to do this. But take the focus away from yourself. Whether itâ€™s through charity, or through work, school, gym; I promise you will stop obsessing over your headache, leg twitch, or your heart flutter. I still have bad days but overall I can say Iâ€™ve improved a great deal from this philosophy.",1
"Anxious about Rabies even though there's no reason to (I think) Hey all. I've been having a hell of a week and, to be honest, looking back, it's really dumb but I can't help but be anxious anyway.

So back on Thursday last week, I was feeding this stray cat. Didn't know it was a stray at first since it's a pretty packed neighborhood with a lot of pet cats, so I didn't expect a stray. After a few days of feeding it, it ended up scratching me because I pet it way too much. Didn't really worry about it too much, washed the cut off and went on with my day.

Then I googled what would happen from a stray cat scratch. *Obviously* this was a mistake, but I did it anyway. First result was Rabies. Cue my panic mode, realizing I could have gotten it from the cat. I started to worry constantly for the next 2 days, and on Saturday, I went to the ER. Doctors didn't think anything would have happened, but they decided to give me the rabies shots anyway just in case. This settled my anxiety for a bit, but I started to worry again, googling if the shots ever failed. They have, but only in countries like India and China, never in the US.

Over the past week, I've been trying to fight with myself that I don't have Rabies. Last time I saw the cat was on Monday, but since it's a stray, I wouldn't expect it to stay around my house since I stopped feeding it. Now, over the past few days, I've started to feel pain in my throat at random times, not triggered by anything. I keep feeling headaches and getting itchiness on my arm (not isolated to it though), and I keep thinking food and drinks aren't going down my throat easily. Logically speaking, it's nothing, but I keep being convinced it's the rabies starting to cause symptoms

Now, I have multiple reasons not to believe I'm gonna have anything wrong, but I can't convince myself that. The likelihood of the cat having rabies with no symptoms is low, me getting rabies from a cat scratch is even lower, and me getting it after getting shots is virtually none, but my mind just won't accept that. I keep thinking of what ifs.
What if the cat had rabies?
What if the scratch gave me rabies?
What if I got the vaccine too late? It was 2 days later, that could have been too late.
What if the vaccine doesn't work and I still get it?
What if my symptoms are from rabies?
What if the cat isn't around because it died from Rabies?

Iâ€™ve been just kind of denying or ignoring this problem for awhile... Occasionally I get either bright red blood in the bowl or like these weird pinkish red chunks in it.
